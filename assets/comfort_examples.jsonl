{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I studied so hard for my chemistry final, but I still failed. I feel so stupid and like I'm never going to succeed at anything.", "output": "I'm so sorry to hear that the exam didn't go the way you hoped, especially after putting in so much effort. It is completely natural to feel disappointed and disheartened when hard work doesn't immediately pay off. Please try to remember that one test score does not define your intelligence or your future worth. You are not stupid; chemistry is a challenging subject, and sometimes things just don't click on the first try. Be gentle with yourself tonight, and maybe when you're ready, you can look at what happened with fresh eyes."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have a presentation tomorrow and I'm terrified. My hands are shaking just thinking about standing in front of everyone. What if I freeze up?", "output": "It is incredibly common to feel this kind of anxiety before a big presentation; your body is reacting to the stress, and that's okay. That fear of freezing up is scary, but often the anticipation is much worse than the actual event. Try to take a few slow, deep breaths to help steady your hands and your racing thoughts. Remember, you have prepared for this, and your classmates are likely more focused on their own turn than judging you. You can do this, one slide at a time."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My roommate ate my food again without asking! I've told them a thousand times to stop, but they just don't respect my boundaries. I'm so mad I could scream.", "output": "It makes total sense that you are furious right now; having your boundaries repeatedly crossed is incredibly frustrating. Food is personal property, and expecting your roommate to respect that is not asking too much. It sounds like you have tried to communicate this clearly, which makes their disregard even more upsetting. Maybe take a moment to cool down so you don't say something you regret, and then have a serious sit-down conversation when you are calmer. You deserve to feel respected in your own home."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm just sitting here trying to decide what to do for the weekend. I don't really have any plans, but I don't feel like doing nothing either.", "output": "It sounds like you are in a bit of a limbo, looking for something to spark your interest but not feeling pulled in any specific direction. That's a pretty normal place to be on a quiet day. Maybe you could try something low-pressure, like going for a walk in a new neighborhood or visiting a local cafe you haven't tried yet. Sometimes just getting outside can help clarity what you actually feel like doing. Whatever you choose, I hope you have a relaxing weekend."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: You won't believe it, but I actually got the internship! I was sure I messed up the interview, but they called me today!", "output": "That is absolutely wonderful news! Congratulations on landing the internship; you must be feeling so relieved and proud of yourself. It is funny how we can be our own worst critics, but clearly, they saw your potential and talent. Take some time to celebrate this victory, because you worked hard for it and you definitely deserve it. I'm so happy for you!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: My best friend and I got into a huge fight, and now she's not answering my texts. I feel like I've lost her forever and I don't know how to fix it.", "output": "I can hear how painful this is for you; the silence from a best friend can feel incredibly loud and isolating. It is really scary to feel like a friendship you cherish is hanging by a thread. Right now, she might just need some space to cool down and process her own feelings, just as you are processing yours. Give it a little time, and try not to panic; many strong friendships go through rough patches and come out stronger. Hang in there."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I went to the cafeteria and saw a bug in the salad bar. It was so gross, I literally lost my appetite for the whole day.", "output": "Ugh, that sounds absolutely repulsing! I don't blame you for losing your appetite after seeing that; it is a completely natural reaction to something so unhygienic. It is really disappointing when you expect a clean meal and get a nasty surprise like that instead. Hopefully, you can find something safe and comforting to eat later when your stomach settles down. Maybe treating yourself to a meal from somewhere you trust would help wash away that memory."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I keep thinking about the future and I feel like I'm running out of time to figure out my life. Everyone else seems to have it together except me.", "output": "That feeling of falling behind is so heavy and overwhelming, but I promise you are not alone in feeling it. It is easy to look at others and assume they have it all figured out, but most people are just doing their best to navigate uncertainty too. You are on your own unique timeline, and there is no deadline for figuring out who you are or what you want to do. Try to focus on just the next right step for you, rather than the whole mountain ahead. You have plenty of time."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: My parents actually agreed to let me travel this summer! I was totally prepared for a 'no', so I'm kind of in shock.", "output": "What an amazing surprise! It is such a great feeling when things work out better than we anticipated. It sounds like you were steeling yourself for disappointment, so this shift to excitement must be quite a rush. Now you can actually start planning and dreaming about your trip, which is the fun part! Enjoy this wave of unexpected good news."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I've been feeling so lonely lately. Even when I'm around people, I feel like I'm on the outside looking in.", "output": "Loneliness is such a difficult and hollow feeling, especially when it hits you even in a crowd. It is really hard to feel disconnected, like there is a glass wall between you and everyone else. Please know that this feeling doesn't mean there is something wrong with you; it just means you are craving deeper connection right now. Maybe try to share a small piece of how you are feeling with someone you trust, or focus on one-on-one interactions which can sometimes feel less isolating. You matter, and you deserve to feel seen."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: I got a parking ticket today for parking in a spot that wasn't even clearly marked! It's so unfair, I can't afford this right now.", "output": "That is incredibly frustrating! It feels so unjust to be penalized for something that wasn't your fault, especially when money is tight. Dealing with unexpected expenses like that can really throw off your whole week and make your blood boil. It might be worth taking photos of the unclear signage and trying to contest the ticket if you have the energy. For now, just let yourself be mad about it; it is a totally valid reaction to an unfair situation."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I just don't like the way I look. I see all these perfect people on Instagram and I just feel ugly and inadequate.", "output": "It is heartbreaking to hear you talk about yourself that way, but I understand how easy it is to fall into that comparison trap. Social media is a highlight reel, often heavily edited, and it is not a fair standard to measure your real, human beauty against. You are worthy and valuable exactly as you are, regardless of how you think you compare to an image on a screen. Maybe taking a little break from those apps could give your mind some space to be kinder to yourself. You deserve to feel comfortable in your own skin."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: My dad has been sick lately and the doctors want to run more tests. I'm so scared it's something serious.", "output": "I am so sorry you are going through this; waiting for medical news is one of the most anxiety-inducing things we can experience. It is completely understandable that your mind is racing to the worst-case scenarios because you care about him so much. Try to take it one day at a time, and lean on your family or friends for support while you wait. No matter what the results are, you will handle it better if you aren't exhausting yourself with worry right now. Sending you strength."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I finished all my classes for the day. Just walking back to the dorm now.", "output": "That sounds like a nice, quiet moment to decompress after a day of learning. The walk back can be a good time to just clear your head and let go of academic thoughts for a bit. I hope you have a relaxing evening ahead of you, maybe with some good food or a show you like. Enjoy the downtime."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I baked cookies for my study group and everyone loved them! It made me feel really good to see them happy.", "output": "That is such a sweet thing to do! There is something really special about sharing food you made and seeing people enjoy it. It sounds like you brought a lot of warmth and joy to your study group today. Hold onto that good feeling; it is a reminder of how your small acts of kindness can brighten people's days. I bet they tasted amazing!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I miss my home. Being at college is great, but sometimes I just want my own bed and my mom's cooking.", "output": "Homesickness is such a real and heavy ache; it is completely normal to miss the comfort and familiarity of home. Even when you are happy where you are, there is no replacement for your own bed and a meal made with love. It is okay to let yourself feel a bit sad about it today. Maybe you could give your mom a call or try to recreate a comfort meal to bring a little piece of home to you. This feeling usually comes in waves, and it will pass."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I was working on a group project and one guy was just so rude and condescending to everyone. It was honestly gross behavior.", "output": "It is really unpleasant to be around that kind of arrogance, especially when you are trying to work as a team. Disrespectful behavior like that leaves a bad taste in everyone's mouth and makes the work so much harder than it needs to be. It is good that you can recognize it for what it is—his problem, not yours. Try to maintain your professionalism and focus on the other group members who are respectful. You shouldn't have to deal with that, but you are handling it well."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I think I might fail this semester. I'm so far behind and I don't know how to catch up. I feel paralyzed.", "output": "That paralysis is a very common reaction to feeling overwhelmed; it's your brain's way of trying to protect you from stress. It feels like a mountain, but you don't have to climb it all at once. Maybe try to identify just one small, manageable assignment you can tackle today to break the ice. If it feels too much, please consider reaching out to your academic advisor or a professor; they are there to help you make a plan, not to judge you. You still have options."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I ran into my ex today at the coffee shop. I thought I'd be a mess, but I actually felt... okay.", "output": "That is a really significant realization! It is often surprising when we brace ourselves for pain and find strength instead. It sounds like you have done a lot of healing and processing since the breakup. Feeling 'okay' is a huge victory and a sign that you are moving forward. Be proud of yourself for handling that situation with such grace."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel so drained. I keep trying to help everyone else with their problems, but nobody asks how I'm doing.", "output": "It is incredibly exhausting to be the strong one all the time, and it hurts when that care isn't reciprocated. You are pouring from an empty cup, and it makes total sense that you feel drained and a bit forgotten. Your needs and feelings are just as important as anyone else's. It might be time to set some gentle boundaries and take a step back to care for yourself for a while. You deserve to be supported too."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: The internet cut out right in the middle of my online exam! I'm panic-emailing the professor but I'm so angry at this stupid wifi.", "output": "Oh no, that is a nightmare scenario! It is completely valid to be furious at technology failing you at the worst possible moment. That sudden spike of stress and anger is a natural physical response to the situation. Keep documenting everything and send those emails; most professors understand that technical issues happen. Take a deep breath to steady your hands while you type. You are doing everything you can right now."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have to make a phone call to schedule a doctor's appointment and I've been putting it off for weeks. I hate talking on the phone.", "output": "Phone anxiety is very real and can make a simple task feel like a huge hurdle. It is understandable that you've been avoiding it, but the anticipation is likely making it feel scarier than it will actually be. Maybe it would help to write down exactly what you want to say beforehand so you have a script to follow. You can do this; it will only take a few minutes, and then the weight will be off your shoulders. Just dial the number and take it one step at a time."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I just finished reading a really good book. It was the best story I've read in years!", "output": "There is nothing quite like the feeling of finishing an amazing book! It sounds like you were totally immersed in that world. That 'book hangover' where you are still thinking about the characters is bittersweet but wonderful. I'm glad you found a story that resonated with you so much. Do you think you'll look for other books by the same author?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm just organizing my desk. It got kind of messy over the week.", "output": "That sounds like a productive and satisfying way to reset for the week ahead. There is something really calming about creating order out of a messy space. Having a clean desk can really help clear your mind too. I hope the process feels therapeutic and you enjoy your tidy space when you're done."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel like I'm drifting apart from my high school friends. We just don't have anything in common anymore.", "output": "Growing apart is a very natural part of life, but that doesn't make it any less painful. It is sad to feel that distance growing with people who used to know you so well. It doesn't mean the friendship wasn't real or important; it just means you are all evolving in different directions. It is okay to grieve that loss while also making space for new connections that fit who you are now. Those memories will always be yours."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I saw someone throw their trash on the ground right next to an empty bin. People are so lazy sometimes.", "output": "That is really frustrating to witness! It is hard not to feel disgusted when people show such a blatant lack of respect for the environment and their community. It takes zero effort to use a bin that is right there. It is good that you care about keeping things clean, even if others are careless. Don't let their laziness ruin your mood, but your annoyance is totally justified."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I'm worried I chose the wrong major. What if I graduate and hate my job?", "output": "That is a very heavy question that many students wrestle with. It is scary to feel like you are locking yourself into a path that might not make you happy. Please remember that your major does not dictate your entire life; many people have careers that have nothing to do with what they studied. You are building transferable skills no matter what. If you are really unsure, maybe talking to a career counselor could help clarify your options. You are not trapped."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: My plant finally bloomed! I've been watering it for months and I thought it was dead.", "output": "Yay! That is such a rewarding moment of success! It just goes to show that patience and consistent care really do pay off. It must be so nice to see that pop of color after waiting so long. You are clearly doing a great job as a plant parent. Enjoy your beautiful new bloom!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I'm just feeling really down today. No specific reason, just heavy.", "output": "Thank you for sharing that with me. Sometimes the heaviness comes without a clear reason, and that can be confusing and exhausting. You don't need a specific 'reason' to feel sad; your feelings are valid just as they are. Be gentle with yourself today—maybe wear your most comfortable clothes, drink some water, and just let yourself be. This cloud will eventually pass, but for now, I'm here with you."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I think someone is following me. I'm walking home alone and I'm scared.", "output": "That is a very scary situation and your safety is the most important thing right now. Please trust your instincts. If you can, head immediately towards a well-lit, public area or a shop that is open. Call a friend or family member so someone knows exactly where you are and can stay on the line with you. If you feel you are in immediate danger, please do not hesitate to call emergency services. Stay alert and get to safety."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I completely failed my calculus midterm today. I studied for two weeks straight, but my mind just went blank when I saw the questions. I feel like I'm not smart enough for this major.", "output": "I'm so sorry to hear that the exam didn't go the way you hoped, especially after putting in so much effort. It is completely normal to feel discouraged when hard work doesn't immediately pay off, but one test does not define your intelligence or your potential in your major. Please be gentle with yourself tonight; you did your best, and that matters."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have to give a presentation in front of the entire class tomorrow. My hands start shaking just thinking about it, and I'm terrified I'm going to stutter or forget everything.", "output": "It sounds like you are carrying a lot of anxiety about tomorrow, and that is a very understandable reaction to public speaking. Many people feel exactly the same way, even if they don't show it. Try to focus on taking slow, deep breaths when the fear spikes, and remember that your classmates are likely more focused on their own presentations than critiquing yours."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My roommate ate the food I meal-prepped for the week without even asking. It's so disrespectful! I barely have any money left for groceries and now I have nothing for lunch.", "output": "That sounds incredibly frustration and unfair; having your boundaries crossed like that would make anyone angry. It is valid to feel upset about your time, money, and effort being disregarded. When you feel ready, it might be helpful to have a calm but firm conversation with them about respecting your property."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I finally finished the huge research paper that's been hanging over my head for a month! I feel so light and relieved. I might actually go out and celebrate tonight.", "output": "That is fantastic news! The relief of finishing a massive project is such a wonderful feeling, and you should be proud of your perseverance. You absolutely deserve to celebrate and enjoy this moment of freedom—have a great time tonight!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: The communal kitchen in my dorm is absolutely filthy. People leave moldy pasta in the sink and sticky spills on the counters. I don't even want to cook in there anymore.", "output": "It is really unpleasant to have to deal with a shared space that isn't being respected, and your reaction is totally valid. Everyone deserves a clean and sanitary place to prepare their food. It sounds exhausting to have to navigate that mess when you just want to eat."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: All my friends are going home for the long weekend, but I can't afford the flight back. I'm going to be stuck here alone on campus while everyone else is with their families.", "output": "It sounds incredibly lonely to be left behind while everyone else is leaving, and I'm sorry you're in that position. Missing out on that time with family and seeing the campus empty can really amplify feelings of isolation. Maybe you can plan a small treat for yourself this weekend, like a movie marathon or a favorite meal, to make the time a little gentler on you."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I'm graduating in two months and I still don't have a job lined up. Everyone asks me 'what's next?' and I just want to scream. I feel like I'm falling behind.", "output": "The pressure to have everything figured out right after graduation is immense, and it makes sense that you are feeling scared and overwhelmed. Please know that everyone's timeline is different, and not having a job immediately does not mean you are falling behind. You are navigating a major life transition, so try to give yourself credit for getting this far."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I guess today was okay. Nothing special happened, just went to classes and came back. Feeling kind of bored.", "output": "Sometimes those quiet, uneventful days can feel a bit flat, but they are also a natural part of the rhythm of life. It is okay to just exist and rest without anything exciting happening. If the boredom gets too loud, maybe listening to some music or taking a short walk could shift the energy a little."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My professor gave me a C on my essay because he disagreed with my opinion, not because the writing was bad. He's so biased and it's going to ruin my GPA.", "output": "It is incredibly frustrating to feel like you are being graded unfairly, especially when it impacts your GPA. You put work into expressing your perspective, and it hurts when that isn't recognized objectively. It might help to visit his office hours to discuss your points calmly, but your anger right now is completely justified."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel like I'm drifting apart from my high school best friend. We used to talk every day, but now she barely replies to my texts. It hurts so much.", "output": "Drifting apart from a close friend is a very specific kind of heartbreak, and I'm sorry you are going through this. It is painful to feel that distance growing when you still care so deeply. It is okay to grieve the way the friendship used to be, even as you both navigate these changes in your lives."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: My parents are fighting constantly and I'm worried they're going to get a divorce. I can't focus on my schoolwork because I'm always waiting for the next bad phone call.", "output": "Carrying the weight of your parents' conflict while trying to focus on school sounds exhausting and scary. It is understandable that your mind is elsewhere, worrying about the stability of your family. Please remember that their relationship issues are not your burden to solve, though I know it is hard not to worry."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: My crush actually asked me to study with them at the library today! We talked for hours and I think it went really well.", "output": "That is so exciting! The butterflies of connecting with someone you like are such a fun experience. I am glad you had a good time and felt that connection; hold onto that happy feeling!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I tried to talk to my advisor about my mental health affecting my grades, and she just told me to 'get organized.' It felt so dismissive and gross.", "output": "That sounds like a deeply invalidating experience, and I am sorry you were met with such a lack of empathy. Opening up about mental health takes courage, and it is disgusting to have that vulnerability met with generic, unhelpful advice. You deserved to be heard and supported, not dismissed."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I look in the mirror and I just hate what I see. Everyone else here looks so fit and put together, and I feel like a slob. I don't want to leave my room.", "output": "It sounds like you are being incredibly harsh on yourself right now, and I'm sorry you're feeling this low about your self-image. Comparing yourself to others is a painful trap, especially when you only see their 'put together' exterior. You are worthy of taking up space and being seen, exactly as you are, even if it doesn't feel like it today."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I think I might have chosen the wrong major. I'm two years in, but I hate the classes. If I switch now, I'll be in debt forever, but if I stay, I'll be miserable.", "output": "That is a really heavy dilemma to be facing, and the fear of making the wrong choice is paralyzing. It makes sense that you feel trapped between two difficult options. Many students face this exact crossroad; take a deep breath and remember you don't have to solve the whole problem today."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm just tired. Not really sad, just... exhausted. I feel like I'm running on autopilot.", "output": "It sounds like you are experiencing burnout or just deep fatigue, which is very common when you've been pushing hard. Running on autopilot is your brain's way of conserving energy. If you can, try to give yourself permission to rest fully without guilt—sometimes we just need to recharge."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: I was working on a group project and two of the members didn't show up to the final meeting. Now I have to do their parts tonight or we all fail.", "output": "That is completely unfair and you have every right to be furious. Being forced to pick up the slack for others who aren't respecting the team's effort is incredibly stressful. You are showing great resilience by stepping up, but make sure to communicate this to your professor so your effort is recognized."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I just got rejected from the internship I really wanted. I thought the interview went perfectly. I don't know what I did wrong.", "output": "Rejection stings, especially when you felt confident about how it went. It is natural to replay the interview and look for faults, but sometimes these decisions are about internal factors you couldn't control. Allow yourself to be disappointed today; it doesn't mean you aren't talented or capable."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: There's a flu going around the dorms and I'm terrified of getting sick right before finals. I'm washing my hands like crazy but I'm still so anxious.", "output": "It is stressful to worry about your health when the stakes are high for your academics. Your anxiety makes sense because you want to do well, but try to trust the precautions you are taking. You are doing what you can to stay safe, and that is all you can control right now."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I finally learned how to cook my mom's pasta recipe! It tastes just like home. I'm so proud of myself.", "output": "That is a wonderful achievement! Food has such a strong connection to memory and comfort, and bringing a piece of home to your kitchen is really special. Enjoy your delicious meal—you earned it!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: A guy in my class keeps making really inappropriate jokes and standing too close to me. It makes my skin crawl.", "output": "That sounds like a very uncomfortable and unsafe situation, and your reaction of disgust is your intuition protecting you. You have every right to your personal space and to feel comfortable in class. Trust your gut feeling, and if you feel able, consider speaking to a TA or someone in authority about his behavior."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: It's my birthday today and nobody remembered. I haven't received a single text. I feel so invisible.", "output": "I am so sorry that your special day has been met with silence; that is a heartbreaking feeling. Feeling invisible on a day that should celebrate you is incredibly painful. Happy Birthday from me—your presence matters, even if the people around you dropped the ball today."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have to have a difficult conversation with my roommate about money. I hate confrontation and I'm scared she's going to blow up at me.", "output": "Confrontation is really hard, especially when it involves living situations and money. It is natural to fear a negative reaction, but advocating for your needs is important. Try to prepare what you want to say beforehand, and remember that setting boundaries is a healthy part of any relationship."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: Finished my book. Now I don't know what to do with myself. Just staring at the ceiling.", "output": "That 'book hangover' feeling can leave you feeling a bit adrift. It is okay to just be still and stare at the ceiling for a while as you process the story. Maybe this is a good moment to just let your mind wander before finding the next thing to engage with."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My laptop crashed and I lost three pages of my essay. I want to throw this thing out the window! Why does this always happen to me?", "output": "That is an absolute nightmare scenario, and I can feel your frustration from here! Losing work is one of the most infuriating things that can happen to a student. Scream into a pillow if you need to; once the initial anger passes, take a breath and remember you wrote it once, so you have the ideas in your head to write it again."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I miss my dog so much. My parents sent a picture of him and I just started crying in the library.", "output": "It is really hard to be away from our pets; they are such a huge source of comfort and love. Crying is a natural release when you are missing home, so don't be embarrassed about letting it out. Maybe you can FaceTime your parents later to see him and say hello?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I went to a party last night and I think I embarrassed myself. I can't remember exactly what I said, but I have this sinking feeling in my stomach.", "output": "That sinking feeling of 'hangxiety' is very common and very uncomfortable. Our brains often fill in the blanks with the worst-case scenarios when we are unsure. Try to be kind to yourself; most people are likely focused on their own night, not scrutinizing yours."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: My professor asked to use my paper as an example for next year's class! I've never been a 'model student' before.", "output": "Wow, what a huge compliment! That validation from a professor proves that your hard work and unique perspective are being recognized. You should be incredibly proud of your academic growth and this achievement."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I found a bug in my salad from the cafeteria. I literally spit it out. I feel sick just thinking about it.", "output": "That is a truly revolt experience, and I don't blame you for feeling sick. Finding something like that in your food is shocking and gross. It might take a while to trust the salad bar again, so maybe stick to hot foods or pre-packaged items until your stomach settles."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel like everyone is moving forward with their lives except me. My friends are getting internships and relationships, and I'm just stuck.", "output": "Comparing your behind-the-scenes with everyone else's highlight reel is a recipe for sadness, but it is hard not to do. Feeling 'stuck' is a very common experience for young adults, even if people don't talk about it. Your path is your own, and it doesn't have to look like anyone else's to be valid and meaningful."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I studied so hard for my chemistry midterm, but I still barely passed. It feels like no matter how much effort I put in, I'm just not smart enough for this major.", "output": "I hear how disappointed you are, and it makes sense that you’d feel that way after putting in so much work. Grades don't define your intelligence or your worth, even though it really feels like they do right now. Maybe you can take a little break to recharge before looking at the test again? You’re trying your best, and that is something to be proud of."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have to give a presentation in my history class tomorrow and I'm terrified. Every time I think about standing in front of everyone, my chest gets tight and I feel like I'm going to forget everything.", "output": "That sounds really anxiety-inducing, and it’s completely normal to feel that physical reaction to public speaking. It sounds like your body is in fight-or-flight mode right now. Have you tried practicing just the first minute of your talk to get comfortable with the start? Remember, your classmates are usually worrying about their own turns, not judging you."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My roommate ate my leftovers again without asking. I explicitly told her that was my dinner for tonight because I have a late shift. I'm so sick of her disrespecting my boundaries.", "output": "It is totally valid to be angry about that; having your boundaries crossed, especially regarding food and your schedule, is really frustrating. You planned your day around that meal, and it’s unfair that she disregarded that. When you're feeling a bit calmer, maybe it’s worth having a serious sit-down to re-establish those house rules?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I finally got the internship I applied for! I was so sure I bombed the interview, but they just emailed me the offer letter. I can't believe it!", "output": "That is absolutely amazing news! Congratulations on landing the internship! It’s such a great feeling when things work out, especially when you were doubting yourself. You must be so relieved and excited to start this new chapter. You definitely earned this moment of celebration!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I walked into the communal kitchen and it smells like rotting trash. Nobody has taken the garbage out in three days and there are dirty dishes everywhere. It's so gross I can't even cook.", "output": "Ugh, that sounds incredibly unpleasant. Living in a shared space requires everyone to pitch in, and it’s really off-putting when basic hygiene is ignored. It’s understandable that you don’t want to be in there right now. Maybe you can grab a quick meal elsewhere tonight just to give yourself a break from the mess?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I don't know, I just feel kind of blah today. Nothing bad happened, but I don't have any energy to do my assignments. Just staring at the wall mostly.", "output": "It sounds like you're having one of those low-energy days, and that is perfectly okay. Sometimes our brains just need a reset, even if there's no specific 'reason' for feeling down. Don't be too hard on yourself for not being productive every single second. Maybe a short walk or some music could help shift the mood a little?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: My best friend from home has stopped replying to my texts. I see her posting stories with her new college friends, and I feel like I'm being replaced. It hurts so much.", "output": "I'm so sorry you're going through this; feeling like you're drifting apart from a close friend is really painful. It’s natural to feel jealous and hurt when you see them moving on, but it doesn't erase the history you have. Transitioning to long-distance friendship is hard for everyone. Maybe she’s just caught up in the newness of things right now?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I'm graduating in two months and I have no idea what I'm doing with my life. Everyone else seems to have jobs lined up, and I'm just staring into the void. What if I fail at being an adult?", "output": "That pre-graduation panic is so real and very common, even if it looks like everyone else has it together. Comparing your behind-the-scenes to everyone else's highlight reel is a recipe for stress. It’s okay not to have the whole map figured out yet; you just need to take the next small step. You have plenty of time to find your path."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: The professor changed the assignment criteria two days before the deadline. It's completely unfair! I've already done half the work based on the old instructions.", "output": "That sounds incredibly frustrating and unfair to pull on students at the last minute. You have every right to be upset about your time and effort being disregarded like that. Have you checked if other students are feeling the same way? Maybe you can approach the professor collectively to ask for an extension or clarification."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I actually passed my driving test! I failed it twice before, so I went in expecting the worst, but the instructor said I did great.", "output": "Wow, what a fantastic surprise! That persistence really paid off. It must feel like such a huge weight off your shoulders to finally have that license. Knowing you can overcome past failures is a great confidence booster. Safe driving out there!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: My group project partner just copied and pasted a Wikipedia article for his section. He didn't even change the font. I can't believe how lazy some people are.", "output": "That is seriously disappointing and unprofessional of him. It’s frustrating when your grade depends on someone who isn't pulling their weight or acting with integrity. You definitely shouldn't have to deal with that level of carelessness. Are you planning to talk to him about it or bring it up with the instructor?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I miss my dog so much. My parents sent me a video of him playing in the yard, and I just started crying. Dorm life is so lonely without him.", "output": "It is so hard to be away from our pets; they are such a huge source of comfort and love. It makes total sense that seeing him would bring up all those emotions. It sounds like you're really feeling the homesickness today. Maybe you can FaceTime your parents later just to say hi to him specifically?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I think I might have overdrawn my bank account. I was trying to be careful, but books were so expensive this semester. I'm scared to even look at the app.", "output": "Financial stress is incredibly heavy, especially when you're trying your best to manage expenses. Avoiding looking at it is a normal reaction to fear, but knowing where you stand is the first step to fixing it. Remember, this is a solvable problem, even if it feels overwhelming right now. Take a deep breath before you check."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: Just finished my last class for the week. Probably just going to sleep and play video games all weekend. Don't really have any other plans.", "output": "That sounds like a very well-deserved chill weekend. After a week of classes, just decompressing with sleep and games is a great way to recover. Enjoy the downtime and don't feel pressured to make 'plans' if you don't want to. Rest is productive too!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: My artwork got selected for the student showcase! I've never had my work displayed in a gallery before. I'm beaming right now.", "output": "That is huge!

Make sure to invite your friends to see it; this is definitely a moment to celebrate your creativity."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel like I don't fit in here. Everyone talks about things I don't understand, and I feel like the odd one out at every social gathering. I just want to go home.", "output": "Feeling like an outsider is such a lonely and isolating experience. It’s really brave of you to keep trying to socialize even when it feels uncomfortable. Finding 'your people' takes time, and it doesn't mean there's anything wrong with you if it hasn't happened yet. Be gentle with yourself while you navigate this new environment."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: I can't believe my boyfriend forgot our anniversary. He didn't even say anything until I brought it up. It just shows how little he cares.", "output": "I can hear how hurt and angry you are, and rightfully so. Anniversaries are important milestones, and having it forgotten feels like a rejection. It doesn't necessarily mean he doesn't care, but it certainly means he dropped the ball big time. It’s important to express to him exactly why this hurt you so he understands."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: My landlord just texted saying they might sell the building. I don't have a lease for next year yet. What if I have nowhere to live?", "output": "That kind of uncertainty about your housing is terrifying. The idea of losing your home is a primal fear, so it's natural to feel panicked. Try to take it one step at a time—until you have official notice, nothing is set in stone. It might be worth looking at local tenant laws or backup options just to give yourself some peace of mind."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I saw a guy in the library coughing all over the computers without covering his mouth. It was so repulsive. People have no manners.", "output": "That is really gross and inconsiderate, especially in a shared public space like a library. Health and hygiene are important, and seeing someone blatantly ignore them is definitely off-putting. It makes sense that you’d feel disgusted and want to stay far away from that area."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I gained the 'freshman 15' and none of my old clothes fit. I feel so ugly and uncomfortable in my own skin. I don't even want to go out.", "output": "I'm so sorry you're feeling this way about your body. Bodies change, especially during big life transitions like college, but that doesn't make it less hard to accept. You are worthy of respect and fun regardless of your clothing size. Maybe getting one or two outfits that fit comfortably now could help you feel a bit more confident?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I cooked a real meal for the first time! usually I just make instant noodles, but I made pasta with sauce from scratch and it actually tasted good.", "output": "Look at you go! Cooking from scratch is a great skill to learn and it sounds like you nailed it. It’s so satisfying to eat something delicious that you made with your own hands. This might be the start of a fun new culinary hobby for you!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: Is it Friday yet? This week feels like it's been five years long. I'm just counting down the hours.", "output": "I totally get that feeling; some weeks just seem to drag on forever. You're almost at the finish line though! Just a few more hours to push through and then you can relax. Hang in there, you've got this."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I sent a risky text to my crush telling him I like him, and he hasn't replied for three hours. I feel sick. I shouldn't have done it.", "output": "The waiting game is absolute torture, isn't it? It takes a lot of guts to be vulnerable like that, and the silence afterwards can feel deafening. Try to distract yourself with something offline if you can. Regardless of the reply, be proud that you were brave enough to say how you feel."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: The bus skipped my stop again! Now I'm going to be late for my lab, and the TA deducts points for lateness. This public transport system is a joke.", "output": "That is infuriating! Being penalized for something completely out of your control is the worst feeling. It’s so stressful when you’re trying to be responsible and the system fails you. Maybe you can email the TA right now to explain the situation before you arrive?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel like I'm drifting through life. I'm not passionate about my major, I don't have a hobby I love. I'm just... existing.", "output": "It sounds like you're feeling really unmoored and empty right now. That sense of just 'existing' can be heavier than sadness sometimes. It’s okay not to have a burning passion right this second. Sometimes we go through seasons of quiet or confusion before we find what sparks us again. You aren't wasting time; you're just figuring it out."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: My strict professor actually gave me an extension on my paper. I was terrified to ask, but he was super understanding about my flu.", "output": "That’s a pleasant surprise! It’s always a relief when authority figures turn out to be more human and understanding than we expect. It sounds like you advocated for yourself well, even though you were scared. Now you can focus on getting better without that deadline looming over you immediately."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: Someone stole my laundry out of the dryer and left it on the dirty floor. Who does that? I have to re-wash everything now.", "output": "That is incredibly rude and disrespectful of your property. It’s baffling that someone would be so inconsiderate in a shared laundry room. Having to do the work twice because of someone else's selfishness is a valid reason to be disgusted. I hope the next load goes much smoother."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I heard a rumor that they are cutting funding for the arts department. If I lose my scholarship, I can't afford to stay here. I don't know what I'll do.", "output": "That is a terrifying possibility, and the uncertainty of your financial future is a heavy burden to carry. It’s hard not to spiral into 'what-ifs' when you hear rumors like that. Try to seek out official information from the department so you know the facts before panicking. You are resilient, and you will find a way to navigate this."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: My mom sent me a care package with my favorite cookies and a handwritten note. It made my whole week.", "output": "That is so sweet! Care packages are like a little hug in a box. It’s wonderful to feel that connection to home and know someone is thinking of you. Enjoy those cookies—they taste even better when they come with love!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: Everyone is going home for the holiday weekend except me because I can't afford the flight. I'm going to be the only one in the dorms.", "output": "That sounds really lonely, and it’s hard not to feel left out when everyone else is leaving. Financial constraints can be so isolating in college. Maybe you can plan a special 'me-time' weekend? Treat yourself to a movie marathon or explore parts of the city you haven't seen yet. You might find there are others staying behind too."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I really messed up my presentation today. I froze in front of everyone and forgot half my slides. I feel so embarrassed.", "output": "It sounds like you had a really tough experience today. It is completely normal to feel embarrassed after freezing up, but please be gentle with yourself. Many people struggle with public speaking anxiety, and one moment does not define your abilities."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have finals coming up next week and I feel completely unprepared. There is just too much material to cover and I'm terrified I'm going to fail everything.", "output": "That sounds incredibly overwhelming and stressful. It makes sense that you are feeling scared when facing such a large workload. Try to take it one small step at a time; you have handled challenges before, and you can get through this too."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My roommate ate my leftovers again without asking. I labeled them clearly! It is so disrespectful and I am sick of it.", "output": "I can hear how frustrated you are, and you have every right to be. It is really upsetting when your boundaries are ignored, especially regarding your personal property. Have you felt able to talk to them about how this makes you feel?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel so lonely lately. All my friends seem to be hanging out without me, and I'm just sitting in my dorm room staring at the wall.", "output": "I am so sorry you are going through this; feeling excluded is deeply painful. It is okay to feel sad about the distance growing between you and your friends. You deserve to feel included and valued in your relationships."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I finally got an A on my chemistry lab! I studied so hard for this one and it actually paid off.", "output": "That is absolutely wonderful news! I am so happy for you; seeing your hard work turn into a great result is such a satisfying feeling. You should be really proud of your dedication."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: The cafeteria food was absolutely revolt today.

It is completely understandable that you would feel grossed out by that. Hopefully, you can find something better and safer to eat later."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: My parents are arguing constantly and I'm scared they might get a divorce. I don't know what will happen to our family.", "output": "I am so sorry you are carrying this heavy worry right now. It is really scary to face uncertainty about your family's future. Please remember that their relationship issues are not your fault or your burden to fix."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm just thinking about what classes to pick for next semester. I'm not sure if I should take the history elective or the art one.", "output": "It sounds like you are in a contemplative space right now. Weighing your options is a smart way to approach your schedule. Whichever you choose, it seems like a good opportunity to explore something that interests you."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: My dog back home passed away this morning. I didn't even get to say goodbye to him. It hurts so much.", "output": "My heart goes out to you; losing a beloved pet is like losing a family member. It is devastating not being there to say goodbye, but I am sure he knew how much you loved him. Take all the time you need to grieve."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I finally finished knitting that scarf I've been working on for months! It's not perfect, but I made it myself.", "output": "That is a fantastic achievement! Finishing a long-term project like that takes so much patience and dedication. Who cares if it isn't 'perfect'? The little imperfections just show it was made by hand with care. I bet it feels incredibly cozy and rewarding to wear something you created from scratch. Wear it with pride!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: The professor changed the due date to tomorrow without telling anyone! How is that fair? Now I have to pull an all-nighter.", "output": "That sounds incredibly unfair and stressful. It is completely valid to feel angry about a sudden change that impacts your schedule so drastically. Do your best, but remember to take care of yourself during the crunch."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I don't think my crush likes me back. I tried talking to him today and he just gave one-word answers and walked away.", "output": "It hurts a lot when our feelings aren't reciprocated, or when we feel ignored. It is brave of you to try reaching out, even if the result wasn't what you hoped for. Be kind to yourself as you process this disappointment."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: My older sister just told me she's engaged! I'm going to be a maid of honor!", "output": "Congratulations to your sister and to you! That is such exciting news. It sounds like you have a wonderful celebration to look forward to, and it's great to see you so full of joy."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I'm graduating in two months and I have no job lined up. Everyone else seems to have offers and I'm just lost.", "output": "The pressure to have everything figured out by graduation is immense, and it is okay to feel scared. Everyone moves at their own pace, and your path doesn't have to look like everyone else's. You still have time to find your way."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I walked into the bathroom and the toilets were overflowing. It smelled terrible and there was water everywhere. I hate this dorm.", "output": "That sounds incredibly gross and frustrating to deal with in your own living space. You shouldn't have to deal with such unsanitary conditions. It makes total sense that you are fed up with the dorm situation."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel like I'm just not smart enough for this major. Everyone else understands the lectures instantly and I'm struggling to keep up.", "output": "It is really hard when you feel like you are falling behind, but please don't judge your intelligence based on a comparison. Everyone learns at different speeds, and struggling with new material doesn't mean you don't belong there."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My group project partners are useless. They haven't done a single thing and the deadline is in two days. I'm going to have to do it all myself.", "output": "It is incredibly frustrating when others don't pull their weight. You have every right to be angry about being put in this position. Is there any way to communicate this to your instructor so you aren't unfairly burdened?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I think I might go for a walk later. The weather is okay, just a bit cloudy.", "output": "Going for a walk sounds like a nice, grounding idea.

{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I lost my wallet somewhere on campus. My ID, my debit card, everything is in there.

{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I think I might have failed that interview. I stumbled over my words and gave a really bad answer to the last question.", "output": "Post-interview anxiety is very common; we often focus on the one thing we did wrong rather than what went right.

We used to talk every day and now it's like we're strangers.", "output": "Growing apart from a close friend is a unique kind of heartbreak. It is really sad to feel that connection fading.

I feel like I'm just not smart enough for this class, and it's really discouraging.", "output": "It is completely understandable to feel discouraged when your hard work doesn't yield the results you hoped for. A single grade does not define your intelligence or your potential to succeed. Please try to be gentle with yourself today; you are doing your best."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have a huge presentation tomorrow in front of the whole department. My hands start shaking just thinking about it, and I'm terrified I'm going to freeze up.", "output": "Public speaking anxiety is very common, and it makes sense that you are feeling nervous about such a big moment.

Purpose is often something found slowly over time, not a race to be won. It is okay to just 'be' for a while without having everything figured out."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm just waiting for my laundry to finish. It's got about ten minutes left on the spin cycle.", "output": "Waiting for chores to finish offers a rare moment of downtime. It sounds like you are staying on top of your responsibilities. I hope you have a relaxing evening once your laundry is done."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have to go to the dentist tomorrow for a filling. I hate needles and the sound of the drill makes me want to cry.", "output": "Dental anxiety is very real and can be quite overwhelming. It is brave of you to go despite the fear because you are taking care of your health. Maybe bringing some headphones and music can help distract you during the appointment."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: The wifi cut out right in the middle of my online quiz! I might get a zero because it wouldn't let me reconnect. I'm so mad at the internet provider.", "output": "That is an incredibly frustrating situation that is completely out of your control. Technical issues during important moments are the worst kind of stress. I hope your professor is understanding if you explain what happened."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: My crush actually sat next to me in lecture today and asked for a pen. We talked for a bit before class started!", "output": "That is such a sweet and exciting moment! It takes courage to engage in those little interactions. Enjoy that warm feeling of connection; it sounds like a highlight of your day."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I keep looking at myself in the mirror and I just hate how I look. I feel so ugly compared to everyone on Instagram.", "output": "I am so sorry you are feeling this way about yourself. It is really hard when social media sets such unrealistic standards for us. Please remember that you are worthy and valuable exactly as you are, regardless of how you feel about your reflection right now."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: A bug crawled across my desk while I was studying. I screamed. I hate insects so much.", "output": "That sounds like a startling and creepy interruption to your study session! Having your personal space invaded by a bug is definitely not a nice feeling. Hopefully, the rest of your study time is critter-free."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I'm graduating in two months and I have no job lined up. I'm terrified I'm going to be unemployed and have to move back home.", "output": "The transition from school to the workforce is one of the most uncertain and scary times in life. It is completely normal to feel terrified about the future. You have time, and everyone's path looks different; try to be patient with yourself during this process."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm thinking about making pasta for dinner. Maybe with some pesto.", "output": "That sounds like a delicious and comforting plan for dinner. Pesto pasta is a great choice for a meal that feels special but is simple to make. Enjoy your cooking and your meal."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel like I'm drowning in assignments. Every time I finish one, two more appear. I just want to curl up in bed and ignore everything.", "output": "It sounds like you are feeling incredibly overwhelmed right now, and that is completely understandable given the workload you described. The urge to retreat when things get heavy is a very natural response to stress. Remember that your worth isn't defined by how many assignments you complete in a day. Would it be possible to take a small break just to breathe before looking at the list again?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have a presentation tomorrow and I'm terrified. I keep imagining myself freezing up in front of everyone and forgetting my words.", "output": "It is really common to feel that kind of anxiety before a presentation; your brain is trying to protect you from a stressful situation. Visualizing the worst-case scenario is something our minds often do, but it doesn't mean it will happen. Try to be gentle with yourself—you have prepared for this. Maybe focusing on just the first sentence of your speech could help ground you?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My roommate ate my food again without asking. We've talked about this three times already! I'm so sick of the disrespect.", "output": "It makes total sense that you are frustrated; having your boundaries repeatedly crossed is really exhausting. You have every right to expect your personal space and belongings to be respected, especially after discussing it. It sounds like you are feeling unheard in your own home. When you feel ready, it might be worth having a firm conversation about how this affects your trust in the living arrangement."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel like I'm the only one in my friend group who isn't in a relationship. It's really getting me down lately.", "output": "It is completely understandable that you are feeling this way; seeing everyone paired up can really highlight feelings of loneliness. Please try to remember that your relationship status does not define your worth or your lovability. Everyone's life moves at a different pace, and being single offers its own kind of freedom and opportunity for growth. It's okay to feel sad about it, but don't let it convince you that you are 'less than' anyone else."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I saw some old friends today and they were just gossiping the whole time. It felt so fake and gross. I don't think I want to be around that energy.", "output": "It sounds like that interaction really clashed with your values, and feeling repelled by that kind of negativity shows a lot of maturity. Growing out of friendships or realizing you need different energy around you is a difficult but healthy realization. You deserve connections that feel genuine and uplifting rather than draining."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm not really feeling much today. Just went to class, came back, ate dinner. It's just a regular, boring day.", "output": "Sometimes having a quiet, uneventful day is exactly what we need to recharge, even if it feels a bit mundane. It is okay to just exist and flow through the routine without any major highs or lows. Is there anything small, like a favorite show or a warm drink, that might add a little comfort to your evening?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: My best friend has been ignoring my texts for two days. I keep wondering if I did something wrong or if they just don't care about me anymore.", "output": "The silence from a friend can be really painful and leave you with so many questions. It is easy to internalize it and blame yourself, but often people pull away due to their own struggles. Your feelings of uncertainty are valid. Maybe give it a little more time, and try to be kind to yourself while you wait."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I actually got the internship! I didn't think I was qualified enough, so I'm in total shock right now.", "output": "Wow, congratulations! It is a pleasant surprise when reality exceeds our own expectations of ourselves. This proves that others see the potential and capability in you that you might have doubted. Take a deep breath and let that excitement sink in—you are clearly more qualified than you gave yourself credit for."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I'm graduating in two months and I have no idea what I'm doing with my life. Everyone else seems to have a plan, but I'm just lost.", "output": "Standing at the edge of a big life transition is scary, and feeling lost is a very shared experience, even if it looks like everyone else has it together. There is no single timeline you have to follow immediately after graduation. It is okay to take things one step at a time rather than having the whole map figured out today."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I miss my family so much. Living in the dorms is fun, but sometimes I just want my mom's cooking and my own bed.", "output": "Homesickness is a heavy feeling, and it is a testament to the love and comfort you have at home. Craving that familiarity and safety is completely normal, especially when you are navigating independent living. Is there a way you can recreate a small part of home here, or perhaps schedule a call with them soon?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: I worked on a group project and ended up doing everything myself. The others just ghosted until the night before. It's so unfair.", "output": "That sounds incredibly infuriating and unfair. Carrying the weight of a team when you expected collaboration is a huge burden, and your resentment is justified. You showed a lot of responsibility by getting it done, but you shouldn't have had to do it alone. It might be helpful to vent this out, and in the future, communicate with your professor if it happens again."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I look in the mirror and I just hate what I see. I feel like I don't fit in with anyone here. Everyone is so perfect.", "output": "It is heartbreaking to hear you speak about yourself that way, and I'm sorry you are going through this struggle with self-image. Comparing ourselves to others who seem 'perfect' often masks the reality that everyone has insecurities. You are worthy of kindness and acceptance, especially from yourself. Please try to be gentle with the person in the mirror today."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: My crush actually said hi to me today and we talked for like five minutes! I'm buzzing.", "output": "That is so exciting! Those little moments of connection can really brighten up your entire day. It sounds like you had a great interaction, and it is lovely to see you so happy about it. Enjoy that warm, buzzing feeling!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I think I might fail this class. If I do, I'll lose my scholarship. I can't stop shaking.", "output": "The stakes feel incredibly high right now, and that physical reaction of shaking shows just how much pressure you are under. It is a terrifying thought, but try to focus on what is within your control right now. Is there an academic advisor or a professor you can speak to about your options? You don't have to carry this fear alone."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I just feel lonely. I have friends, but I don't feel connected to any of them. I'm always the one reaching out.", "output": "Loneliness can feel even deeper when you are surrounded by people but lack that genuine connection. It is exhausting to always be the initiator, and it hurts to feel like the effort isn't reciprocated. You deserve relationships where you feel seen and valued. Sometimes it helps to express this need to them, or to seek out new spaces where connections might flow more naturally."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: Just finished a book. It was okay. Now I don't know what to do with myself.", "output": "That 'book hangover' feeling where you are stuck between worlds can be a bit disorienting. It sounds like you are in a calm, transitional moment. Maybe this is a good time to stretch, grab a snack, or just let your mind wander for a bit before jumping into the next activity."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: My professor actually extended the deadline for everyone. I was pulling an all-nighter and now I can actually sleep.", "output": "That must be such a huge relief! It is a wonderful surprise when the pressure is suddenly lifted. It sounds like your body and mind really need that rest. Please take advantage of this gift and get some good sleep—you definitely deserve it."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My parents are trying to control who I date. I'm 20 years old! They treat me like a child.", "output": "It is extremely frustrating when your autonomy isn't respected, especially as you are stepping into adulthood. You are building your own life and identity, and having that challenged feels stifling. Your feelings of anger are a signal that your boundaries are being crossed. It is tough, but standing firm in your values is part of growing up."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: My dog passed away yesterday. I've had him since I was a kid. The house feels so empty.", "output": "I am so deeply sorry for your loss. Losing a childhood pet is losing a family member and a constant source of unconditional love. The silence in the house can be the hardest part. Allow yourself to grieve and cry as much as you need to; the pain you feel is a reflection of the great love you shared."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have to make a phone call to the doctor and I hate talking on the phone. My heart is racing.", "output": "Phone anxiety is very real and can be physically uncomfortable, just as you are describing. It is okay to feel scared about it. Sometimes writing down a script of exactly what you want to say beforehand can help steady your nerves. You can do this, one small step at a time."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: The cafeteria food was absolutely revoltng today. It smelled like old socks. I couldn't even eat.", "output": "That sounds like a really unpleasant sensory experience. Not being able to find a decent meal when you are hungry is really frustrating and disappointing. Hopefully, you can find something else to eat later that is actually appetizing and nourishing."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I finally cleaned my room! It was a mess for months, but now I can actually see the floor.", "output": "That is a fantastic accomplishment! Breaking through that procrastination and clearing your space often clears your mind too. It must feel so much lighter and more peaceful in there now. Great job on taking care of your environment!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel like I'm falling behind everyone else. My friends are getting jobs and traveling, and I'm just stuck here.", "output": "Comparing your behind-the-scenes with everyone else's highlight reel is a painful trap, but it is so easy to fall into. Feeling 'stuck' is a heavy emotion, but your path is unique to you and doesn't need to look like theirs. You are moving at your own pace, and that is perfectly okay."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: The bus drove right past me even though I waved! Now I'm going to be late for work. I'm fuming.", "output": "That is incredibly aggravating! Doing everything right and still facing consequences because of someone else's negligence is maddening. It is completely valid to be angry about the added stress this causes to your morning. Take a deep breath; you will handle whatever comes next, even if you are late."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I think I offended my friend with a joke I made. They got quiet and left early. I'm scared I ruined the friendship.", "output": "It is really scary when we think we've hurt someone we care about. That anxiety about the future of the friendship shows how much you value them. The best approach might be to reach out with a genuine apology and check in. Mistakes happen, and honest communication can often repair the rift."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm just organizing my notes for next week. Nothing special going on.", "output": "It sounds like you are being productive and setting yourself up for success, which is a great way to spend the time. Sometimes a quiet, organized moment is really grounding. Good luck with getting everything in order!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I ran into my ex on campus today. I thought I'd be sad, but I actually felt... nothing. It was weird.", "output": "That is a very interesting realization to have. It can be surprising when our emotional reaction is different from what we predicted. Indifference is often a sign of healing and moving forward. It sounds like you have processed more than you realized!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I tried to cook a nice dinner and I burned it. I feel so useless. I can't even do simple things right.", "output": "Please be gentle with yourself; a kitchen mishap doesn't define your competence or your worth. It is really disheartening when efforts don't turn out as planned, especially when you are tired. It was just an accident, not a reflection of your ability to handle life. Maybe order something you enjoy tonight?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: My parents sent me a care package with my favorite snacks. It made my whole week.", "output": "That is such a sweet gesture! Knowing that someone is thinking of you and knows exactly what brings you joy is a wonderful feeling. Enjoy those snacks—they act as a little reminder of home and love."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I hear noises outside my apartment and I'm home alone. It's probably nothing but I'm freaking out.", "output": "It is completely natural to feel on edge when you hear unexplained sounds while alone; your survival instincts are kicking in. Please prioritize your safety and peace of mind—check that the doors are locked and maybe turn on some music or a light. If you truly feel unsafe, don't hesitate to call a friend or campus security."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I honestly don't know what to do anymore. I studied so hard for that chemistry midterm, and I still barely passed. It feels like no matter how much effort I put in, I'm just not smart enough for this major.", "output": "I hear how discouraged you're feeling right now, and it makes total sense that you'd feel that way after putting in so much work. It is really tough when our results don't match the effort we exerted. Please try to be gentle with yourself tonight; one test doesn't define your intelligence or your potential."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: My presentation is tomorrow and I'm terrified. Every time I think about standing in front of the class, my chest gets tight and I feel like I'm going to forget everything. What if I freeze up?", "output": "It is completely normal to feel those nerves before a big presentation; almost everyone gets that tight feeling in their chest. That anxiety shows that you care about doing a good job. Maybe try taking a few slow, deep breaths to center yourself, and remember that your classmates are likely focusing on their own work, not judging you."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My roommate ate my leftovers again! I specifically labeled them with my name. It’s so disrespectful, and I’m sick of having to confront him about basic boundaries every single week.", "output": "That sounds incredibly frustrating! It is really valid to feel angry when your boundaries are repeatedly crossed, especially regarding your personal property and food. Living with others can be so difficult when there isn't mutual respect. Have you considered having a sit-down conversation when you're feeling a bit calmer to set some firm house rules?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: You won't believe it—I actually got the internship! I was so sure I bombed the interview, but they just emailed me the offer. I'm literally shaking right now!", "output": "That is absolutely amazing news! Congratulations! It sounds like your hard work and preparation really paid off, even if you were worried about the interview. Take some time to celebrate this win—you definitely deserve it!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I walked into the communal bathroom this morning and it was absolutely filthy. Someone left hair everywhere and didn't even flush. It honestly makes me want to move out right now.", "output": "Ugh, that sounds really unpleasant. It is totally understandable that you'd feel disgusted by that; hygiene is such a basic expectation in shared spaces. Dealing with that kind of mess is never fun. Maybe you can bring it up with your RA or housing services if it keeps happening?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I guess today was okay. Nothing really happened. I just went to class, ate lunch, and came back to my dorm. Kind of a boring Tuesday.", "output": "Sometimes those quiet, uneventful days are exactly what we need to recharge. It sounds like a steady, routine day. Do you have anything planned for the evening, or are you just going to take it easy?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I just found out that my best friend from high school is transferring to my university next semester! We haven't talked in months, so I had no idea. I'm still processing it.", "output": "Wow, what a huge surprise! It must be such a shock to hear that out of the blue. It sounds like it could be a really exciting change to have a familiar face around campus. How are you feeling about reconnecting with them?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I miss my dog so much. My parents sent me a picture of him sleeping on my bed back home, and I just started crying. It's so lonely here without him.", "output": "It is so hard being away from our pets; they really are like family. Seeing a picture like that can bring up so much homesickness. It's okay to cry and miss him—it just shows how strong your bond is. Maybe you can FaceTime your parents later to see him 'live'?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have to call financial aid today to sort out my loans, and I'm dreading it. I don't understand half the terminology they use, and I'm scared I'm going to mess up my funding for next year.", "output": "Financial stuff can be incredibly intimidating and confusing, so your fear is very valid. You are definitely not alone in feeling overwhelmed by all that terminology. It might help to write down your questions beforehand so you don't feel put on the spot. You've got this."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: The professor changed the due date to tonight without even emailing us! I only saw it because I checked the portal by accident. That is so unfair to everyone who has work shifts tonight.", "output": "That sounds incredibly unfair and stressful. It makes total sense that you are angry about a sudden change like that, especially when you have other commitments. It's really hard to plan your life when things shift without notice. I hope you can manage to get it done, or perhaps the class can appeal for an extension?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: My crush finally asked me to hang out! We're going to get coffee tomorrow afternoon. I've been smiling for like an hour straight.", "output": "That is so sweet! I'm smiling just reading this. It's such a great feeling when someone you like reciprocates that interest. I hope you have a wonderful time at coffee tomorrow—enjoy the excitement!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: Everyone else seems to have found their 'group' already, and I'm still eating dinner alone every night. I feel like I'm doing something wrong socially.", "output": "It is really painful to feel like you're on the outside looking in. Please know that it's very common to feel this way, even if it looks like everyone else has it figured out. Friendships take time to form. You aren't doing anything wrong; you just haven't found your people yet."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm just trying to decide whether to study for history or start my English paper. I don't really have the motivation for either, honestly.", "output": "That procrastination struggle is real. It's hard to get started when neither option sounds appealing. Maybe you could try the 'five-minute rule'—just commit to doing five minutes of one task and see how it goes?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: A guy in my lecture kept making really inappropriate jokes today. It made everyone uncomfortable, but he wouldn't stop. It was so gross.", "output": "I'm sorry you had to sit through that; it sounds really uncomfortable and disrespectful. It is completely valid to feel repulsed by behavior that crosses lines like that. You have every right to a learning environment where you feel respected."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I think I might have chosen the wrong major. I'm three years in, but I hate my upper-level classes. What if I graduate and hate my job? Is it too late to change?", "output": "That is a really heavy realization to grapple with, and it's normal to feel scared about your future. Many people question their path, even late in their degree. It is rarely 'too late' to pivot, though it might look different than you expected. Maybe talking to a career counselor could help clarify your options?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I finally finished that 20-page paper! It took me all week, but I just hit submit. I feel light as a feather.", "output": "What a relief! Turning in a massive project like that is such a satisfying moment. You must be so proud of yourself for pushing through and getting it done. Make sure you do something fun or relaxing to celebrate finishing!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: My grandma is sick, and I'm stuck here at school for finals. I feel so guilty for not being home with my family right now.", "output": "That is an incredibly difficult position to be in. The guilt you're feeling shows how much you love your family, but please remember you are doing what you need to do for your education, which I'm sure she would want. Be kind to yourself during this stressful time."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I got a random package in the mail today from my mom. She sent cookies and a new sweater. I wasn't expecting anything since it's not my birthday.", "output": "That is such a lovely surprise! Care packages from home can really brighten up a random week. It sounds like your mom was thinking of you and wanted to send a little love. I hope the cookies are delicious!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: I can't believe my group partner ghosted me. The project is due tomorrow, and he hasn't answered a single text. Now I have to do his half of the work.", "output": "That is beyond frustrating. It is completely unfair that you are being forced to pick up the slack because someone else isn't responsible. You have every right to be angry. Make sure you document your communication attempts in case you need to show your professor later."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I've been feeling really dizzy lately and I Googled my symptoms. Now I'm convinced I have something serious and I'm too scared to go to the doctor.", "output": "Health anxiety is really scary, and looking up symptoms online often makes it feel much worse. While I can't give medical advice, it is usually better to get checked out by a professional just to be safe and get peace of mind. The campus health center is there to help you, not to scare you."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm thinking about rushing a sorority next semester. I'm not sure if it's for me, but my sister thinks I should try it.", "output": "It sounds like you're weighing your options carefully. Rushing can be a big commitment, but it can also be a way to meet new people. It's okay to be on the fence. Maybe you can go to a few informational events to see if the vibe fits you?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I just feel really burnout. I used to love painting, but I haven't picked up a brush in months because I'm so drained from school.", "output": "Burnout is so real, and it's heartbreaking when it takes away the energy for things we love. It makes sense that you're feeling sad about losing that connection to your art. Maybe you can try just painting for five minutes with no pressure, or maybe you just need to rest right now. Both are okay."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I tried that new coffee shop downtown and the latte tasted like burnt milk. It was expensive too! total waste of money.", "output": "That is so disappointing, especially when you pay a premium price! There's nothing worse than looking forward to a treat and having it be gross. I definitely understand the annoyance of wasting money on bad coffee."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: My roommate and I actually had a really deep talk last night. We've been kind of distant, but I think we finally understand each other better.", "output": "That is wonderful progress! Clearing the air and connecting on a deeper level can make your living situation feel so much more comfortable. It sounds like you both put in the effort to bridge that gap. I'm really happy for you."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I'm going to a party tonight where I don't know anyone except the host. I'm really socially anxious and worried I'll just stand in the corner awkwardly.", "output": "Social anxiety can make events like that feel like climbing a mountain. It's really brave of you to go despite the fear. Maybe you can set a small goal, like introducing yourself to just one new person? And remember, it's totally okay to leave early if you get overwhelmed."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I checked my bank account and I have way less money than I thought. I must have spent more on food this month than I realized. I'm kind of shocked.", "output": "That kind of shock is a really sinking feeling. It's easy to lose track of small expenses until they add up. Try not to panic; now that you know, you can adjust your budget for the rest of the month. It happens to the best of us!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My parents are threatening to stop paying my tuition if I don't change my major to Business. It's my life, not theirs! I'm so mad they're using money to control me.", "output": "That sounds incredibly controlling and unfair. It is your life and your future, so it's natural to feel angry when that autonomy is threatened. Financial pressure from family is a really heavy burden to carry. I hope you can find a way to communicate your passion to them, or explore other funding options."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel like I'm drifting apart from my high school friends. We used to talk every day, and now the group chat is silent for weeks.", "output": "Growing apart is one of the most painful parts of moving into adulthood. It doesn't mean the friendship wasn't real or important, but it still hurts to feel that distance growing. It's okay to grieve the way things used to be. Maybe reaching out individually could help spark a conversation?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I need to buy groceries, but it's raining. I'm trying to decide if I should just order delivery or suck it up and walk.", "output": "The classic rainy day dilemma! It really depends on how much you value your comfort versus your budget today. If staying dry and cozy is worth the delivery fee to you, go for it. Otherwise, maybe a raincoat and some music could make the walk bearable?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I just finished setting up my dorm room with all my posters and lights. It finally feels like *my* space instead of just a generic room.", "output": "That is such a great feeling! Having a space that reflects your personality makes such a difference in how at-home you feel. It sounds like you've created a really cozy sanctuary for yourself. Enjoy your new setup!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I studied so hard for my chemistry midterm, but I ended up barely passing. I feel like such a failure, and I don't know if I'm cut out for this major.", "output": "I'm so sorry to hear that you're feeling this way; it is incredibly frustrating when our hard work doesn't yield the results we expect. Please remember that one test score doesn't define your intelligence or your potential in your major. It might help to take a little break to decompress, and then maybe look over the exam to see where things went wrong without judging yourself."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have to give a presentation in my history class tomorrow and I'm absolutely terrified. I hate public speaking and I'm scared I'm going to freeze up or forget everything.", "output": "It is completely normal to feel anxious about public speaking; almost everyone gets those butterflies before a presentation. You have prepared for this, and even if you stumble a little, your classmates are likely focused on their own work and are rooting for you. Try to take some deep breaths and remember that the presentation is just a few minutes of your life."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My roommate left their dirty dishes in the sink for the third day in a row. We made a cleaning schedule, and they are just completely ignoring it. It's so disrespectful.", "output": "That sounds really frustrating, especially when you have already agreed on a schedule together. Living with others is difficult, and it makes sense that you feel disrespected when your boundaries are ignored. When you're feeling calmer, it might be worth having another honest conversation with them about how this affects you."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I finally got the internship I applied for! I've been refreshing my email all week and I just got the offer letter. I'm so excited!", "output": "That is absolutely amazing news! Congratulations on getting the internship; waiting for that email must have been so nerve-wracking. You should be really proud of yourself for achieving this goal, and I hope you take some time to celebrate this win!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I went to the dining hall today and the food looked absolutely gross. The lettuce was wilted and brown, and I just lost my appetite completely.", "output": "Ugh, that sounds really unappealing; there is nothing worse than looking forward to a meal and finding it inedible. It's totally understandable that you lost your appetite seeing that. Hopefully, you can find something fresher to eat somewhere else so you don't go hungry."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: Just spending the day in the library. I have a lot of reading to catch up on, so I'll probably be here until dinner.", "output": "It sounds like you have a productive day ahead of you. Library days can be long, so make sure to take small breaks to stretch your legs and stay hydrated. Good luck with catching up on your reading!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel so lonely lately. Everyone seems to have their own friend groups already, and I'm just sitting in my dorm room by myself every Friday night.", "output": "I hear how painful that loneliness is, and I want you to know that you aren't alone in feeling this way, especially in college. It takes time to find your people, and it can be really hard to be patient when you feel isolated. Maybe there's a club or a small event you could check out this week, just to be around others without too much pressure?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I walked into my dorm and my parents were there! They drove up to surprise me for the weekend. I had no idea they were coming.", "output": "What a massive surprise! It must have been quite a shock to see them there when you weren't expecting it at all. I hope it's a pleasant surprise and that you have a wonderful time catching up with them this weekend."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I don't know what I'm going to do after graduation. Everyone else seems to have jobs lined up or grad school plans, and I have absolutely nothing. I feel like I'm falling behind.", "output": "The uncertainty of the future can be really scary, and it is very common to feel like you're the only one without a plan, even though many others are in the same boat. You are on your own unique timeline, and it is okay not to have everything figured out right this second. Try to focus on one small step you can take today rather than the whole mountain of the future."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My professor gave me a C on my essay because he disagreed with my opinion. I cited all my sources and followed the rubric. It's so unfair.", "output": "That sounds incredibly unfair and frustrating, especially when you followed all the guidelines. It's natural to be angry when you feel your work is being judged subjectively rather than objectively. It might be worth going to office hours to respectfully discuss your grade and ask for clarification on the rubric."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: My long-distance boyfriend is coming to visit next week! We haven't seen each other in three months.", "output": "That is so sweet! I can imagine how much you are looking forward to seeing him after such a long wait. I hope you two have a wonderful time together and make some great memories during his visit."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: My dog back home passed away this morning. I can't believe I'm not there to say goodbye to him. I feel terrible.", "output": "I am so incredibly sorry for your loss; losing a pet is losing a family member, and being away from home makes it so much harder. Please be gentle with yourself right now and allow yourself to grieve. Your dog knew how much you loved him, even if you weren't there at the very end."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: My lab partner keeps making really inappropriate jokes during class. It makes me feel so uncomfortable and I just want to get away from him.", "output": "That sounds like a really uncomfortable situation, and you shouldn't have to deal with that kind of behavior while trying to learn. Your feelings of disgust are a valid reaction to having your boundaries crossed. Is there a TA or professor you might feel comfortable speaking to about switching partners or addressing the behavior?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm thinking about changing my major to Psychology. I've taken a few classes and they seem interesting, but I haven't decided yet.", "output": "It sounds like you are in a thoughtful place of exploring your options. Psychology is a fascinating field, and it's great that you're paying attention to what interests you. Take your time with the decision; maybe talking to an advisor or a student in that major could help you clarify your thoughts."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I think I might have offended my best friend yesterday. She hasn't texted me back all day, and usually, we talk constantly. I'm scared I ruined the friendship.", "output": "It is really anxiety-inducing when the communication pattern changes with someone you care about. It's easy to jump to the worst-case scenario, but there might be other reasons she hasn't replied, like being busy or needing space. Maybe give it a little more time, or send a gentle follow-up asking if everything is okay."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: The internet in my apartment has been down for six hours. I have an assignment due at midnight and I can't submit it. I am fuming.", "output": "That is an incredibly stressful and maddening situation to be in when you have a deadline looming. It is totally valid to be angry at technical failures that are out of your control. If you can, try to take screenshots or document the outage, and maybe email your professor from your phone to explain the situation before the deadline."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I just found out that classes are cancelled tomorrow because of the snow! I was fully prepared to wake up at 7 AM.", "output": "That is the best kind of surprise! It must be such a relief to suddenly have that time back to sleep in or relax. Enjoy your unexpected snow day and make sure to do something cozy for yourself!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I just went through a breakup. We were together for two years. I feel empty and I don't know how to be single anymore.", "output": "I am so sorry you are going through this heart-wrenching change. Ending a two-year relationship is a huge loss, and feeling empty or lost is a very normal part of the grieving process. Take it one day at a time, and remember to lean on your friends and family for support right now."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I walked into the communal bathroom and it was filthy. People are so gross and don't clean up after themselves.", "output": "That is really unpleasant and frustrating; you deserve to have a clean space to use. It is baffling how inconsiderate people can be in shared living spaces. It makes total sense that you feel disgusted by that lack of hygiene."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I finished my final project three days early! Now I can actually enjoy my weekend without stressing.", "output": "Wow, that is a huge accomplishment! Finishing early requires a lot of discipline, and now you get the reward of a guilt-free weekend. Enjoy your well-deserved relaxation time!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I checked my bank account and I have way less money than I thought. I don't know how I'm going to afford groceries for the rest of the month.", "output": "Financial stress is incredibly heavy and scary, and seeing a low balance can really make your stomach drop. You are dealing with a very real challenge. Are there any campus resources, like a food pantry or student emergency fund, that you might be able to access to help bridge the gap?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm just walking to my next class. It's kind of a long walk across campus.", "output": "Those cross-campus walks can definitely take a chunk out of your day. I hope the weather is decent for your walk at least. Maybe it's a good chance to listen to a song you like or just clear your head before the next lecture."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My group project members are useless. I ended up doing the entire slide deck myself last night because nobody else contributed.", "output": "That is unfair and exhausting; you shouldn't have to carry the weight of an entire group on your shoulders. It is completely reasonable to be angry about their lack of effort. You might consider documenting what you did versus what they did, in case you need to discuss it with your instructor."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I'm really homesick today. I miss my mom's cooking and sleeping in my own bed. College feels so cold sometimes.", "output": "Homesickness hits in waves, and it sounds like today is a particularly hard one. Missing the comfort of home and your mom's cooking is a very deep ache. Be gentle with yourself today; maybe you can call your mom or eat something that reminds you of home?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: A random person in the coffee shop paid for my drink today! It made my whole day.", "output": "That is such a lovely gesture! Random acts of kindness like that can really turn a whole day around. I'm so glad you got to experience that little spark of joy today."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: My professor actually complimented my question in class. Usually he's so strict and scary, so I was shocked.", "output": "That must have felt really validating! It is always surprising when a strict authority figure shows appreciation for your input. It sounds like you asked something really insightful, so good job speaking up!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I found a weird lump on my neck and I'm spiraling. I'm scared it's something serious.", "output": "It is really scary to find something unexpected regarding your health, and it's easy for your mind to jump to the worst conclusions. While I can't give medical advice, I would gently encourage you to visit the student health center or a doctor just to get it checked out for your peace of mind."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I found out my friend has been spreading rumors about me behind my back. It makes me sick to my stomach that I trusted them.", "output": "That is a terrible betrayal of trust, and feeling sick to your stomach is a very real reaction to that kind of fakeness. You trusted them, and they violated that; it is completely valid to feel disgusted by their behavior. You deserve friends who respect and protect your reputation."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I didn't get invited to the party everyone is talking about. I feel like such a loser.", "output": "It hurts so much to feel excluded, especially when it seems like 'everyone' else is involved. You are definitely not a loser, even though this situation makes you feel that way. Sometimes these things are just oversights or logistics, but it doesn't make the feeling of rejection sting any less."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I need to do laundry, but I'm out of detergent. I guess I have to go to the store first.", "output": "That sounds like a bit of a hassle before you can get your chores done. Hopefully, the store isn't too far away so you can get back and get that laundry cycle started. Good luck getting everything sorted!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I just found out I failed my chemistry midterm. I studied so hard for it, and now I feel like I'm never going to catch up with the rest of the class. It feels pointless to even try anymore.", "output": "I'm so sorry to hear about your midterm. It is incredibly frustrating when the results don't reflect the hard work you put in, and it makes total sense that you're feeling discouraged right now. Please remember that one exam doesn't define your intelligence or your future. Maybe take tonight to just rest and do something kind for yourself before looking at next steps?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have to give a presentation in my history seminar tomorrow and I'm terrified. My hands start shaking whenever I have to speak in front of people. I'm scared I'm going to freeze up and everyone will laugh.", "output": "It is completely normal to feel anxious about public speaking; so many people feel exactly the same way. That fear of freezing up is really scary, but you are more capable than you think. Try to focus on taking slow, deep breaths when you feel that shaking start. You've got this, and even if you stumble, people are usually much kinder than we expect."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: You won't believe it, but I actually got the internship I applied for! I was sure I blew the interview, but they just emailed me an offer letter.", "output": "That is absolutely amazing news! Congratulations on landing the internship! It’s such a great feeling when things work out, especially after you were worried about it. You should definitely do something fun to celebrate this achievement!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My roommate left her dirty dishes in the sink for the third day in a row. We've talked about this so many times and she just doesn't respect my space or my time. I'm fuming.", "output": "It is really understandable that you are angry about this. Having your boundaries ignored repeatedly, especially in your own home, is exhausting and disrespectful. It sounds like you've been very patient already. Maybe once you've had a moment to cool down, you can have a serious conversation about how this is affecting your friendship."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I walked into the communal kitchen in my dorm and there was moldy food everywhere. It smelled so bad I almost threw up. I hate living here sometimes.", "output": "That sounds incredibly unpleasant; nobody wants to deal with a mess like that where they eat. It's totally valid to feel disgusted and frustrated by the lack of cleanliness in your shared space. Is there an RA or building manager you can report this to so you don't have to deal with it alone?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I don't really have much going on today. Just sitting around my apartment, maybe I'll watch a movie later or something. feeling kind of bored.", "output": "Sometimes having a slow, boring day is actually a nice reset. It’s okay to just exist and not be productive for a while. If you do decide to watch a movie later, I hope it's a good one!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: My friend from high school just showed up at my door without calling. I haven't seen him in two years! I'm totally in shock.", "output": "Wow, that is a huge surprise! It must be quite a shock to see someone from your past so unexpectedly. I hope it's a pleasant surprise and that you two have a good time catching up."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel so lonely lately. Everyone seems to have their own friend groups and I'm just on the outside looking in. I spent the whole weekend in my room.", "output": "I hear you, and I want you to know that feeling lonely is a very heavy and difficult burden to carry. It can seem like everyone else is connected, but many people are struggling just like you are. It takes time to find your people, so please be patient and gentle with yourself while you navigate this."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: My parents have been fighting a lot recently and I'm scared they might get a divorce. I don't know what will happen to our family if they split up.", "output": "That is a really scary situation to be in, and I'm so sorry you're going through this uncertainty. It’s hard to watch the people you love struggle with each other. Remember that their relationship issues are not your fault, and whatever happens, you will find a way through it."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I finally finished that painting I've been working on for months. It looks exactly how I imagined it in my head. I'm so proud of myself.", "output": "That is fantastic! Finishing a long-term creative project is such a satisfying feeling. You have every right to be proud of yourself for sticking with it and bringing your vision to life."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: I got a parking ticket even though I was only five minutes late getting back to my car. It's so unfair, I literally saw the guy writing it as I walked up.", "output": "Ugh, that is incredibly frustrating. It feels so unfair to be penalized for such a small timing mistake, especially when you were right there. Allow yourself to be annoyed for a bit—it’s a totally valid reaction to a bad luck situation."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I just don't feel comfortable in my own skin. I look in the mirror and I just see flaws. I wish I could look like anyone else but me.", "output": "It breaks my heart to hear you talk about yourself that way. Struggling with self-image is painful, but please remember that what you see in the mirror doesn't capture your kindness, your humor, or your worth. You are enough just as you are, even if it's hard to believe that right now."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: The bus driver drove right past me even though I was waving at the stop! Now I'm going to be late for work.", "output": "That is infuriating! It is so disrespectful when you are doing everything right and still get ignored like that. Being late through no fault of your own is incredibly stressful, especially when it involves work. Take a deep breath; you have every right to be annoyed, but don't let his mistake ruin your entire day. Hopefully, your boss will be understanding given the situation."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: Someone on the bus was coughing without covering their mouth right behind me. It was so gross, I felt like I needed a shower immediately.", "output": "That really is unpleasant and inconsiderate. It makes total sense that you'd feel grossed out by someone invading your personal space and hygiene like that. Hopefully, you're in a cleaner, more comfortable space now."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I just found a twenty dollar bill in an old jacket pocket! I totally forgot I put it there.", "output": "That is the best kind of surprise! It’s like a little gift from your past self to your present self. I hope you treat yourself to something nice with it!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm just waiting for my next class to start. Sitting on a bench outside. The weather is okay.", "output": "Sounds like a peaceful moment in between the busyness of the day. Enjoy the fresh air and the downtime while you have it."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: My boyfriend broke up with me via text message this morning. I feel like trash. After a year together, I didn't even deserve a phone call?", "output": "I am so incredibly sorry. You absolutely deserved better than that; ending a long relationship over text is very hurtful and disrespectful. It’s okay to cry and feel broken right now. Give yourself time to grieve the relationship."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My professor changed the requirements for the final paper two days before it's due. I have to rewrite half of it now. I am so mad!", "output": "That sounds incredibly stressful and unfair. Having the goalposts moved at the last minute is a surefire way to feel angry and overwhelmed. Take a deep breath, maybe scream into a pillow if you need to, and then just do what you can."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I think I accidentally sent a screenshot of a chat to the person I was talking about. My heart is pounding out of my chest.", "output": "Oh no, that is that intense 'stomach drop' feeling. It’s a scary mistake, but remember that these things happen to almost everyone at some point. Whatever the fallout is, you will be able to handle it. Just breathe."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: My little sister called me just to say she missed me. We haven't been close lately, so it really made my day.", "output": "That is so sweet! Reconnecting with family, especially when things have been distant, is such a warm feeling. It sounds like she really values you. I'm glad you got that moment of connection today."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel like I'm an imposter in my major. Everyone else seems so smart and articulate, and I'm just faking it until I get caught.", "output": "Imposter syndrome is such a heavy thing to carry, but I promise you are not alone in feeling this way. Most of the people who seem 'smart and articulate' are likely struggling with their own doubts too. You earned your spot there just as much as anyone else."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I tried a new coffee shop and the milk was definitely spoiled. It tasted sour and clumpy. Ugh.", "output": "Ew, that sounds absolutely nasty! There is nothing worse than expecting a nice coffee and getting... that. I hope you can get the taste out of your mouth soon with something actually delicious."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I got an A on my physics exam? I thought I failed it for sure. I'm literally staring at the grade in disbelief.", "output": "What a fantastic surprise! It sounds like you underestimated how much you actually knew. You should be really proud of yourself for pulling that off, especially when you were expecting the worst."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have a dentist appointment in an hour and I hate the dentist. I know it's childish but I'm really scared of the pain.", "output": "It is not childish at all; dental anxiety is extremely common for adults too. It’s a vulnerable situation to be in. Maybe let the dentist know you're anxious so they can be extra gentle with you? You'll be through it soon."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My group project partners are useless. I'm doing all the work and they're going to get the same grade as me. It makes my blood boil.", "output": "That is a classic source of frustration and you have every right to be angry. It is not fair to carry the workload for everyone else. Is it possible to talk to the professor about the uneven contribution, or do you just want to vent? Either way, I'm listening."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I managed to run a full 5k this morning without stopping! I've been training for weeks and I finally did it.", "output": "That is a huge accomplishment! Sticking to a training goal and seeing it pay off is such a powerful feeling. You should be super proud of your discipline and your physical progress!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: My dog is getting really old and having trouble walking. I know he won't be around forever, but the thought of losing him hurts so much.", "output": "I am so sorry. Watching a beloved pet age is a deep and specific kind of heartache. It sounds like he is very loved, and right now, just being there for him and making him comfortable is the best gift you can give him."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: Just organized my bookshelf. Put them in color order. It looks okay I guess.", "output": "That sounds like a satisfying little project. Sometimes organizing our physical space can help our minds feel a little more ordered too. Color-coded shelves usually look pretty cool!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I heard a weird noise outside my window and now I can't sleep. I know it's probably nothing but I'm spooked.", "output": "It is totally natural to feel spooked by unexplained noises at night. Our brains are wired to be alert. Maybe try turning on a soft light or listening to some calming music to help distract your mind until you feel safe enough to sleep."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: My friends threw me a surprise birthday party! I had no idea. I feel so loved right now.", "output": "That is so wonderful! It sounds like you have a great group of friends who really care about you. Enjoy this feeling of being celebrated—you deserve it!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I just failed my math midterm. I studied all week for it, but my mind went blank the moment I saw the paper. Now I feel like I'm never going to graduate.", "output": "I'm so sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It is incredibly frustrating to put in so much effort and not see the results you hoped for. Please remember that one test does not define your intelligence or your future. Take some time to rest, and be kind to yourself today."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have a presentation tomorrow and I'm terrified. My hands start shaking just thinking about standing in front of the class. I feel like everyone is going to judge me.", "output": "It makes so much sense that you are feeling nervous about your presentation. Public speaking is a very common fear, and the anticipation is often the hardest part. Try to focus on taking slow, deep breaths when the anxiety spikes. You have prepared for this, and you can get through it one step at a time."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My roommate ate my leftovers again without asking. I labeled them clearly! It feels so disrespectful that she just ignores my boundaries like this.", "output": "That sounds incredibly frustrating and disrespectful. It is completely valid to feel angry when your boundaries are ignored, especially in your own home. Living with others can be challenging, but you deserve to have your space and property respected. Maybe when you are calmer, you can have a firm conversation about expectations."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I finally got the internship I applied for! I was so sure I messed up the interview, but they just called to offer me the position.", "output": "That is absolutely wonderful news! Congratulations on landing the internship! It sounds like all your hard work and preparation really paid off, even if you were worried about the interview. Take a moment to celebrate this achievement—you earned it!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel so lonely lately. Everyone else seems to have a tight group of friends, but I just go to class and come home. It feels like I'm invisible.", "output": "I hear how painful that loneliness feels right now. It can be really isolating to see others connecting while you feel on the outside looking in. Please know that you are seen and your feelings matter. Sometimes building connections takes time, but you are worthy of friendship and belonging."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I found out my friend has been spreading rumors about me behind my back. It makes me sick to my stomach to think I trusted them. I don't even want to look at them.", "output": "It is completely understandable that you feel disgusted and betrayed. Discovering that someone you trusted has broken that trust is deeply hurtful. Your reaction to want distance is a natural way to protect yourself. Give yourself permission to process this betrayal without forcing yourself to interact with them right now."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm not really sure how I feel today. Just kind of going through the motions. Nothing bad happened, but nothing good did either.", "output": "It is okay to have days where everything feels a bit flat or routine. Not every day has to be filled with high emotions or big events. Sometimes just getting through the day is enough. Be gentle with yourself and allow yourself to just exist in this space for a bit."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: My parents are fighting a lot recently, and I'm scared they might get a divorce. The house feels so tense all the time, and I don't know what's going to happen to us.", "output": "I am so sorry you are living with that tension and uncertainty at home. It is really scary to feel like your family stability is threatened. While you cannot control their relationship, your feelings of fear are valid. Try to find a safe space, maybe with a friend or a hobby, where you can take a break from the atmosphere at home."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I miss my dog so much. He passed away last month, and coming home to an empty house still makes me cry. I don't know when this heavy feeling will go away.", "output": "Losing a beloved pet is losing a family member, and the grief is very real. It is completely normal to still be crying and feeling that heaviness a month later. There is no timeline for grief, so please don't rush yourself. Allow yourself to miss him and cherish the memories you have."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: My professor actually praised my essay in front of the whole class. I usually get average grades, so I was totally shocked. I didn't think I was that good at writing.", "output": "What a pleasant surprise! It sounds like a wonderful validation of your skills that you weren't expecting. Sometimes we underestimate our own abilities until someone else points them out. I hope this moment gives you a confidence boost in your writing moving forward."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: I've been working on this group project alone because no one else replies to the chat. It's due in two days! Why do I always have to carry the slack for lazy people?", "output": "It is completely unfair that you are being left to do all the work. Feeling angry about carrying the burden for a group project is a very natural reaction. You shouldn't have to sacrifice your peace of mind because others aren't stepping up. Do what you can, but remember your worth isn't tied to covering for everyone else."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I saw my ex with someone new today. I thought I was over it, but it just hit me like a ton of bricks. I feel like I'm back to square one.", "output": "Seeing an ex move on can be incredibly jarring, even if you thought you were healed. It doesn't mean you are back to square one; healing is often non-linear. It is okay to feel sad and hurt by this today. Be extra kind to yourself and remember how far you have come already."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have to choose a major soon, and I have no idea what I want to do. Everyone else seems to have a plan. What if I pick the wrong thing and ruin my life?", "output": "The pressure to choose a life path is immense, and it makes sense that you feel scared. Remember that choosing a major is rarely a permanent life sentence; many people change paths later. You are not alone in feeling uncertain, even if it looks like others have it figured out. Take it one step at a time and trust that you can adapt."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: My long-distance best friend just surprised me with a visit! We haven't seen each other in a year. I'm so excited I can barely type.", "output": "That is such an amazing surprise! Reconnecting with a best friend after so long is a truly special feeling. I can feel your excitement through your message! Enjoy every moment of your time together and make some wonderful new memories."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel really insecure about my body lately. Social media makes me feel like I'm not fit enough or pretty enough. I just want to hide in baggy clothes.", "output": "I am sorry you are struggling with these negative thoughts about yourself. Comparing ourselves to curated images on social media is so draining and often unfair. Your value is not defined by your appearance or how you compare to others. It is okay to wear what makes you feel comfortable and safe right now."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: The cafeteria food was literally moldy today. I almost took a bite before I noticed. It's so gross that we pay so much for meal plans and get served trash.", "output": "That sounds absolutely revolting and unacceptable. You have every right to be disgusted and upset about the quality of food you are being served. Health and safety should be a priority, especially when you are paying for a service. I hope you were able to find something safe to eat elsewhere."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I think I might fail this semester. I've fallen so far behind on readings and assignments. I'm paralyzed by how much I have to do.", "output": "That paralysis is a very common response to feeling overwhelmed. It is scary to feel like you are losing control of your academic progress. Instead of looking at the whole mountain of work, try to focus on just one small task today. You can't fix everything at once, and that is okay."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: My friends went to a concert without inviting me. I saw the photos on Instagram. I thought we were close, but now I'm questioning everything.", "output": "It hurts deeply to feel excluded, especially by people you consider close friends. Seeing it play out on social media just adds salt to the wound. It is valid to question the friendship and feel sad about being left out. You deserve friends who make you feel included and valued."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My parents are forcing me to come home every weekend. I want to have a life here at college! They just won't let me grow up and it's suffocating.", "output": "It sounds incredibly frustrating to feel like your independence is being stifled. You are in a time of life where exploring your autonomy is important. It is natural to feel angry when that growth is restricted.

I don't have a 'thing' like everyone else.", "output": "It is heavy to feel like you don't have a specific talent that defines you. But please remember that being a well-rounded human is valuable too. You don't need to be the best at something to be worthy or interesting. Your 'thing' might just be being you, and that is enough."}

Usually I just eat instant noodles, but I made pasta and it actually tasted good.", "output": "That is a fantastic achievement! Cooking for yourself is a great form of self-care and independence.

I literally watched the guy write it as I ran up.", "output": "That is maddening! It feels so unfair to be penalized for such a small timing difference.

My stomach is in knots.", "output": "Confrontation is really scary for a lot of people, so your physical reaction is totally normal.

Boring way to spend a Sunday afternoon.", "output": "Laundry is definitely one of those never-ending chores.

It makes me feel so gross and uncomfortable.", "output": "I am so sorry you have to deal with that; it sounds like a really uncomfortable environment.

If you feel safe doing so, you might consider speaking to the instructor about it."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: My old friend from high school just texted me out of the blue. We haven't talked in three years.", "output": "That is quite unexpected!

{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I'm just having one of those days where everything feels heavy and I can't stop crying for no reason. I feel like a mess.", "output": "It is okay to have days where everything feels heavy; sometimes we just need to let those tears out. You are not a mess, you are just human and experiencing emotions. Be gentle with yourself today and maybe wrap up in a warm blanket if you can."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel like I'm drowning in coursework. Everyone else seems to manage just fine, but I can barely get out of bed to go to class.", "output": "I hear how overwhelmed you are right now, and it's completely understandable given how much pressure you're under. Comparing yourself to others is something we all do, but it rarely reflects the full picture of anyone's struggles. Please try to be gentle with yourself; sometimes just getting out of bed is a victory in itself. Would it feel helpful to break just one small task down for today, or maybe just take some time to rest without guilt?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My roommate ate my food again without asking. I've told them a thousand times, and they just laugh it off like it's no big deal.", "output": "That sounds incredibly frustrating, especially when you’ve already set a clear boundary about your food. It makes sense that you feel disrespected when your requests are ignored and then laughed off. Your feelings are valid; personal space and belongings matter in a shared living situation. Have you considered having a serious sit-down conversation when you are both calm to explain exactly how this makes you feel?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have a presentation tomorrow and I'm terrified I'm going to freeze up. My heart races just thinking about standing in front of everyone.", "output": "It is very normal to feel that rush of anxiety before a big presentation; your body is reacting to something important to you. The fear of freezing up is really common, but remember that you have prepared for this. Try to focus on your breathing right now to help slow that racing heart. No matter what happens tomorrow, your worth isn't defined by this one moment."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I finally got an A on my math test! I studied for weeks and I was so sure I'd fail, but I actually did it.", "output": "That is wonderful news! I can hear the relief and pride in your voice, and you absolutely deserve to celebrate this achievement. Putting in weeks of effort and seeing it pay off is such a rewarding feeling. Take a moment to really soak this in—you proved to yourself that you are capable of overcoming challenges!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I saw my ex at the party acting like nothing happened between us. It made me feel sick to my stomach just looking at them.", "output": "It’s really tough to see someone who caused you pain acting as if everything is fine. That visceral reaction in your stomach is your body’s way of processing that hurt and unfairness. You have every right to feel repulsed by that behavior; it feels inauthentic and dismissive of your history. Maybe give yourself some space from them for a while to protect your peace?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: My friends went out to the movies without inviting me. I saw the photos on Instagram and now I feel so lonely.", "output": "Seeing those photos must have hurt deeply; the feeling of being left out is one of the loneliest feelings there is. It’s natural to wonder why you weren't included, but try not to let your mind create stories about your worth based on this one event. Sometimes plans happen spontaneously without malicious intent, though that doesn't make it hurt less. Would you feel up to reaching out to one of them later to catch up?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm just tired. Not really sad or anything, just exhausted from the routine of wake up, study, sleep, repeat.", "output": "It sounds like you are experiencing burnout from the monotony of your daily grind. That feeling of being drained without being specifically sad is a sign your mind and body need a change of pace. Routine can be stabilizing, but it can also be numbing if there's no variety. Is there a small hobby or a short walk you could squeeze in to break up the cycle?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprise\nUser: My parents actually agreed to let me take a gap year. I was fully prepared for a fight, but they just said okay.", "output": "Wow, that must be such a shock, but in the best way possible! It sounds like you were bracing yourself for conflict and instead found acceptance. It’s a relief when the people we care about surprise us with support we didn't expect. Now you have the mental space to actually plan your year instead of fighting for it!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I don't know what I want to do with my life. Everyone else has internships lined up, and I feel like I'm falling behind.", "output": "The pressure to have everything figured out right now is immense, but it is okay not to know yet. Feeling like you are falling behind is a scary thought, but life isn't a race with a single track. Many people find their path through exploration, not by having a plan from day one. Trust that you are exactly where you need to be to learn what you need to learn."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel like I'm not good enough for my job. Everyone else seems so much smarter and faster than me.", "output": "Imposter syndrome is such a heavy burden to carry, and it lies to us by comparing our insides to everyone else's outsides. You were hired because they saw value and capability in you. It is okay to be on a learning curve; that doesn't mean you aren't 'good enough.' Be gentle with yourself; you are likely doing much better than you think you are."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My professor gave me a C on a paper I worked so hard on. His comments didn't even make sense!", "output": "It is incredibly frustrating to feel like your hard work hasn't been recognized or understood. Getting a grade that doesn't reflect your effort, especially with confusing feedback, feels very unfair. It’s okay to be angry about this; you care about your performance. Once the initial anger settles, perhaps you could visit office hours to ask for clarification on his comments?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: The cafeteria food was moldy today. I can't believe we pay so much tuition for this garbage.", "output": "That is absolutely unacceptable and frankly, quite gross. You have every right to be disgusted; access to safe and fresh food is a basic necessity, especially given the cost of tuition. It feels disrespectful to students when services are that poor. Have you considered reporting this to student services or the dining administration?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I made a new friend in my history class today. We talked for an hour after class about video games.", "output": "That is such a sweet highlight to your day! connecting with someone new, especially over a shared passion like video games, feels so energizing. It takes courage to open up and talk, and look at the great result! I hope this is the start of a fun and supportive friendship for you."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel ugly today. I looked in the mirror and just hated everything I saw.", "output": "I am so sorry you are having a heavy body image day; those days are really painful. It’s hard when our own reflection feels like an enemy, but please remember feelings aren't facts. You are worth so much more than your appearance, even if it's hard to feel that right now. Be gentle with yourself today—wear something comfortable and try to avoid the mirror if it triggers you."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: My bank account is almost empty and rent is due next week. I don't know how I'm going to make it.", "output": "Financial stress is one of the scariest things to deal with, and your panic is completely valid. The uncertainty of how to cover basic needs like rent creates a huge weight on your shoulders. Take a deep breath; panic makes it harder to see solutions. are there any campus resources or emergency funds you could look into, or perhaps a friend you could talk to for temporary advice?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I finished the book I was reading. It was okay, I guess. Not sure what to read next.", "output": "It sounds like that book didn't quite leave the lasting impression you were hoping for. Sometimes finishing a story feels a bit anticlimactic when it was just 'okay'. It’s a nice blank slate moment, though—you get to choose a new adventure now. Do you usually like to stick to the same genre, or are you in the mood for something totally different?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: My parents are getting a divorce. I know I'm an adult now, but it still feels like my world is shattering.", "output": "Just because you are an adult doesn't mean your parents' separation hurts any less. It is a huge shift in the foundation of your family life, and feeling like your world is shattering is a very real reaction. You are allowed to grieve the loss of the family unit you knew. Give yourself time to process this change; you don't have to be 'grown up' about your feelings."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: I got stuck in traffic for two hours and missed my shift at work. My boss yelled at me even though it wasn't my fault.", "output": "That sounds like a nightmare morning; being trapped in traffic is stressful enough without being yelled at afterwards. It feels so unjust to be blamed for circumstances completely out of your control. Your anger is a natural response to being treated unfairly after you were already stressed. I hope you can do something relaxing tonight to shake off that bad energy."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I think I might have chosen the wrong major. I'm two years in, and I hate all my classes.", "output": "Realizing you might be on a path that doesn't fit is a terrifying feeling, especially after investing time and money. It makes sense that you feel scared about the future and 'wasted' time. However, knowing what you *don't* like is valuable information, too. Many skills are transferable; maybe speaking to an academic advisor could help you see options you haven't considered yet?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: My long-distance boyfriend surprised me with a visit! I haven't seen him in three months.", "output": "That is the best kind of surprise! The joy of reuniting after months apart is such a powerful and happy feeling. I'm sure seeing him in person has filled up your emotional cup. Enjoy every moment of your time together; you two definitely deserve this happiness after waiting so long."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel like I'm not good at anything. Everyone has a talent except me.", "output": "It is a heavy and lonely feeling to believe you don't have a special spark like others seem to. But talent often looks different on everyone—sometimes it's being a good listener, or being kind, not just singing or sports. You have value simply because you exist, not because of what you can perform. Maybe you just haven't found your specific passion yet, and that is okay."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: My group project partner copied their entire section from Wikipedia. It's so lazy and unethical.", "output": "Ugh, that is incredibly disappointing and frustrating to deal with. It feels like a violation of trust when a partner tries to cut corners in such an unethical way. Your disgust is valid; you want to do good work and their laziness jeopardizes that. You might need to address this with them or the professor to protect your own grade and integrity."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I heard a rumor that there might be layoffs at my part-time job. I really need this income.", "output": "The threat of losing your income source is incredibly destabilizing and scary. Living with that uncertainty creates a constant hum of anxiety. It is completely understandable that you are worried about how you will manage if the rumors are true. While you wait for confirmation, maybe it would help to casually look at other job postings just to feel a bit more prepared?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: The weather has been gray for a week straight. It's making it hard to wake up in the mornings.", "output": "A lack of sunshine can really mess with our internal clocks and energy levels. It’s very common to feel sluggish and unmotivated when the sky is constantly gray. You aren't lazy; your body is just reacting to the lack of light. Maybe trying a daylight lamp or forcing yourself to get outside for a few minutes could help reset your rhythm a little?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I tried to cook a nice dinner for my friends but I burned everything. I feel so stupid.", "output": "Oh no, that is such a disappointing outcome when you put so much heart into trying to do something nice. It’s easy to feel stupid in the moment, but please be kind to yourself—even professional chefs burn things sometimes! Your friends likely appreciate the effort and the intention far more than the food itself. Maybe you can all order pizza and laugh about it together?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: Someone stole my bike from the rack outside the library. I had a lock on it and everything!", "output": "That is infuriating! You took the right precautions and someone still violated your property rights. It feels so unfair to be punished for someone else's crime, especially when you rely on that bike. Allow yourself to be angry; it’s a healthy reaction to injustice. Do you have the serial number to report it to campus security, just in case it turns up?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have to call the doctor to make an appointment, but I hate talking on the phone. I've been putting it off for days.", "output": "Phone anxiety is very real and can be surprisingly paralyzing. It feels like a mountain you have to climb just to do a simple task. It’s okay that you've been putting it off; avoidance is a way we try to protect ourselves from stress. Maybe writing down exactly what you want to say beforehand could act as a script and make the call feel a little more manageable?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: I've been on hold with customer service for an hour. The music is driving me insane!", "output": "That is the absolute worst! Being stuck in phone limbo is a huge waste of your time and patience. The repetitive music just adds insult to injury. It is totally valid to feel like hanging up and screaming. Hang in there; hopefully, a human will pick up soon and resolve your issue quickly so you can be done with this."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel like I'm drifting apart from my high school best friend. We hardly talk anymore.", "output": "Growing apart from a childhood friend is a unique kind of heartbreak. It’s sad to realize that the connection isn't what it used to be, even if no one is at fault. Life changes and distance make it hard to keep that same rhythm. It’s okay to mourn the change in the friendship, but remember that the history you share still matters, even if the present looks different."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I heard a strange noise outside my window last night and I couldn't sleep. I live alone so it really spooked me.", "output": "That is a really scary experience; our primitive brains are wired to be alert to those kinds of sounds. Living alone can make those moments feel much more vulnerable. It makes sense that you couldn't sleep after that adrenaline spike. Maybe checking your locks before bed or having a nightlight could help you feel a tiny bit more secure tonight. You are safe now."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel like I'm drowning in my coursework. Every time I finish one assignment, three more pop up. I don't know if I can keep up with this pace much longer.", "output": "I hear how overwhelmed you are feeling right now, and it makes total sense given that workload. It is really draining to feel like you are constantly running just to stay in place. Please remember to take small breaks to breathe; you are doing the best you can."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have a presentation tomorrow and I'm terrified. My hands shake just thinking about standing in front of the class. What if I forget everything I'm supposed to say?", "output": "It is completely normal to feel that anxiety before a big presentation. That physical reaction is your body trying to prepare you, even though it feels scary. Try to visualize yourself getting through it just one slide at a time—you’ve got this."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My roommate left the kitchen a total mess again. We talked about this last week, and she promised to clean up. I'm so sick of being the only one who cares about our living space.", "output": "That sounds incredibly frustrating, especially since you already tried to address it with her. It hurts when it feels like your boundaries and requests are being ignored. You have every right to feel annoyed by the lack of consideration."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I finally got an A on my chemistry midterm! I studied for two weeks straight and I was so sure I failed. I can't believe it actually paid off.", "output": "That is absolutely wonderful news! Seeing your hard work translate into success is such a rewarding feeling. You should be really proud of your dedication and resilience in studying so hard."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm just sitting here staring at the wall. I don't really have anything to do today. It's kind of boring, but also kinda nice to not have plans.", "output": "Sometimes having a quiet, uneventful day is exactly what we need to recharge. It is okay to just exist and do nothing for a while. Enjoy the stillness and the break from your usual schedule."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I tried the new cafeteria food today and it was absolutely gross. It looked like it had been sitting out for hours. I lost my appetite immediately.", "output": "Ugh, that sounds really unappealing. There is nothing worse than looking forward to a meal and being met with something inedible. Hopefully, you can find something fresher and tastier to eat later."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: My best friend and I haven't spoken in three days. We got into a stupid argument over a text message, and now neither of us is reaching out. I miss her but I'm scared she hates me.", "output": "The silence after an argument with a close friend is so painful and anxiety-inducing. It shows how much you value her friendship that this distance hurts so much. Maybe give it a little more time, or reach out with a simple message when you feel ready."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprise\nUser: I just found out my parents are coming to visit this weekend! They didn't tell me until five minutes ago. I have to clean my entire apartment in like two days.", "output": "Wow, that is definitely a sudden curveball! It is sweet that they are visiting, but springing it on you last minute adds so much pressure. Take a deep breath; you can tackle the cleaning in bursts rather than all at once."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I'm graduating in two months and I still don't have a job lined up. Everyone else seems to have offers already. I'm scared I'm going to be unemployed and have to move back home.", "output": "That post-graduation uncertainty is a really heavy weight to carry. It is easy to compare yourself to others, but everyone’s timeline is different and that doesn't diminish your worth. You still have time, and it is okay to take things one application at a time."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel really lonely lately. Even when I'm around people, I feel like I'm on the outside looking in. I don't think anyone really knows me.", "output": "Feeling lonely in a crowd is a profound and difficult type of isolation. It sounds like you are craving a deeper, more authentic connection than what you are currently getting. You deserve to be seen and understood for who you truly are."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: The professor changed the due date to be two days earlier without emailing us! I checked the syllabus and it says Friday, but the portal says Wednesday. This is so unfair.", "output": "That is incredibly unfair and chaotic. Sudden changes without proper communication can really throw off your schedule and increase stress. It might be worth sending a polite email to clarify, as other students are probably confused too."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I saw someone cheating during the exam today. They had their phone under the desk the whole time. It makes me sick that I studied so hard and they're just faking it.", "output": "It is really disheartening to see dishonesty like that when you put in genuine effort. That sense of injustice is completely valid because you value integrity. Try to focus on the fact that your grade reflects your own hard work and knowledge."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: My crush just asked me if I wanted to grab coffee next week! I tried to act cool but inside I was screaming. I've liked him for months.", "output": "That is so exciting! It is such a great feeling when the person you are interested in makes a move to get to know you better. I hope you have a wonderful time and get to enjoy that nervous-happy energy!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I didn't get into the study abroad program I wanted. I had my heart set on going to Spain. Now I'm stuck here for another semester while my friends go travel.", "output": "I'm so sorry you didn't get the news you were hoping for. It is really hard to let go of a dream you had already pictured in your mind. Allow yourself to grieve that missed opportunity; it is okay to feel disappointed."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I think I might have offended my boss today. I made a joke that didn't land, and he just stared at me. I'm worried this is going to affect my evaluation.", "output": " awkward moments like that can replay in our heads on a loop, making us feel so anxious. Most likely, he has already moved past it, even if it felt huge to you. Try to be kind to yourself; we all have moments where things don't come out quite right."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm just walking to class right now. It's a bit cloudy but not too cold. Just a regular Tuesday, I guess.", "output": "Sounds like a calm, steady start to your day. Sometimes those regular, cloudy Tuesdays are nice because they don't ask too much of us. I hope the rest of your walk is peaceful."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My group project members are useless. I've done 90% of the work and they haven't even replied to the group chat. I'm not going to let them tank my grade.", "output": "It is infuriating when you are forced to carry the weight for a whole team. You shouldn't have to sacrifice your time and energy because others aren't stepping up. Is there a way to let the instructor know about the imbalance in contribution?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: My dog passed away yesterday. I've had him since I was ten. The house feels so empty without him clicking his claws on the floor.", "output": "I am so incredibly sorry for your loss. Losing a childhood pet is like losing a family member and a best friend all at once. It is normal for the silence in the house to feel heavy right now; take all the time you need to mourn him."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprise\nUser: I just checked my bank account and I have way less money than I thought. I must have forgotten about a subscription renewal or something. I'm shocked.", "output": "That kind of financial surprise gives you such a jolt in the pit of your stomach. It is really stressful to see a balance lower than you expected. Maybe take a moment to review the transaction history so you can regain a sense of control."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: My parents are fighting all the time lately. Every time the phone rings, I'm scared it's my mom calling to tell me they're getting a divorce. I can't focus on school.", "output": "Living with that constant anticipation of bad news is exhausting and terrifying. It makes total sense that you can't focus on school when your family foundation feels shaky. Please remember that their relationship issues are not your burden to solve."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I accidentally drank from a milk carton that expired two weeks ago. The taste was awful and now I feel nauseous just thinking about it.", "output": "Oh no, that is a horrible sensory experience. It is totally natural to feel queasy after tasting something spoiled like that. Maybe try drinking some water or tea to help wash the taste and the memory away."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I finished my last final! I am officially done with this semester. I'm going to sleep for like 12 hours straight.", "output": "Congratulations on crossing the finish line! The relief of completing a semester is unmatched. You have definitely earned that rest, so enjoy your sleep and the freedom from deadlines!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel like I'm not good at anything. Everyone else has a talent or a hobby they excel at, and I'm just average at everything. It makes me feel worthless.", "output": "It is painful to feel like you don't stand out, but being 'average' does not diminish your value as a person. You are worthy of love and respect simply because you exist, not because of what you produce or achieve. Be gentle with yourself."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: Someone hit my car in the parking lot and didn't leave a note. There's a huge dent in the bumper. People are so dishonest!", "output": "That is maddening! It is a terrible feeling to deal with damage caused by someone else's carelessness and lack of integrity. You have every right to be angry about the hassle and expense this causes you."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have to get a cavity filled tomorrow and I hate the dentist. The sound of the drill makes me panic. I'm thinking about cancelling the appointment.", "output": "Dental anxiety is very real and very common, so you aren't alone in feeling this way. It might help to tell the dentist you are nervous so they can take extra care with you. You are brave for facing a health need even when it scares you."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprise\nUser: I ran into my elementary school teacher at the grocery store today. I haven't seen her in 10 years! She actually remembered my name.", "output": "What a delightful and unexpected encounter! It is amazing how people from our past can pop up when we least expect it. It must have felt really special that she remembered you after all this time."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm organizing my bookshelf today. Just sorting things by color. It's not exciting but it needs to be done.", "output": "There can be something oddly satisfying about organizing and creating order in your space. It sounds like a productive but low-stress way to spend your time. Hopefully, the result looks great when you are finished."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I really miss home today. The food here isn't the same, and I miss my own bed. I feel like I don't belong in this city.", "output": "Homesickness comes in waves, and today sounds like a particularly high tide. It is hard when the comforts of home feel so far away. It is okay to acknowledge that this city doesn't feel like home yet; give yourself space to feel that longing."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: My roommate and I cooked a dinner that actually tasted good! We usually burn everything, but this time we followed the recipe and it was delicious.", "output": "That is a great little victory! Cooking a successful meal together is such a fun bonding experience, not to mention a tasty one. It sounds like a lovely evening of good food and teamwork."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I'm worried I chose the wrong major. I'm three years in, but I don't know if I actually want to work in this field. It feels too late to switch now.", "output": "That realization can feel incredibly scary and trapping. It is a lot of pressure to map out your whole life at a young age. Remember that your major doesn't dictate your entire future path, and skills are often transferable in ways we don't expect."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel like I'm falling behind in all my classes. Everyone else seems to get it instantly, but I have to study for hours just to barely pass. It makes me feel so stupid.", "output": "It sounds incredibly tough to feel like you're working so hard without seeing the results you want. Please remember that everyone learns at their own pace, and comparing your behind-the-scenes struggles to others' highlight reels can be really discouraging. You are definitely not stupid; you are persistent, which is a valuable trait. Have you considered talking to a tutor or academic advisor to see if they can help adjust your study strategies?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have a huge presentation tomorrow and I'm terrified. I hate public speaking. My hands shake, my voice cracks, and I'm scared I'll forget everything I planned to say.", "output": "It is completely normal to feel nervous before a big presentation; public speaking is a common fear for many people. It sounds like the anticipation is really weighing on you right now. Try to be gentle with yourself and remember that your classmates are likely focused on their own nerves too. Maybe practicing a few deep breathing exercises could help steady your voice and hands?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My roommate borrowed my headphones without asking again, and now he can't find them. I've told him a million times to just ask me first. I'm so done with this disrespect.", "output": "That sounds incredibly frustrating, especially since you've already set a clear boundary about asking first. It makes sense that you feel disrespected when your personal items aren't treated with care. Your feelings are valid, and it might be time to have a more serious conversation about boundaries when you're feeling calmer. You deserve to feel that your property is safe in your own home."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: My strict teacher actually made a joke in class today. The whole room went silent for a second before laughing.", "output": "That must have been such a shock! Seeing a strict authority figure break character humanizes them in a way that can be really disarming. It sounds like a funny moment of collective surprise for the whole class. It is nice when those rigid environments soften up, even just for a moment."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: The cafeteria served this mystery meat today that literally smelled like wet dog. I lost my appetite immediately. I just wish we had better food options on campus.", "output": "That sounds really unpleasant! It's hard to keep your energy up for classes when the food options are so unappealing. It’s totally reasonable to feel grossed out by something that doesn't look or smell edible. Maybe you can keep some snacks you actually enjoy in your bag for days when the cafeteria menu misses the mark?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm just going through my schedule for next semester. Trying to decide if I should take the morning calculus class or the evening one. Not really sure which fits my rhythm better.", "output": "Planning your schedule can definitely be a bit of a puzzle. It sounds like you're trying to be strategic about when you'll be most productive. If you're not a morning person, the evening class might save you some stress, but getting it done early has its perks too. Trust your gut on when you tend to feel most alert!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: My best friend and I have been drifting apart since we went to different colleges. We used to talk every day, but now she takes days to reply. I miss her so much.", "output": "It is really painful to feel a close friendship changing, especially when you value that connection so much. Distance can be a difficult hurdle, and it makes sense that you're grieving the way things used to be. It doesn't mean the friendship is over, but the dynamic might be shifting. Have you tried setting up a specific time for a weekly video call to reconnect?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I don't know what I want to do after graduation. The real world seems so big and scary, and I feel like I have no direction while everyone else has jobs lined up.", "output": "The transition from school to the 'real world' is a massive change, and it is very common to feel overwhelmed by the uncertainty. It can feel isolating when it seems like everyone else has a plan, but many people are just figuring it out as they go. It is okay not to have everything mapped out right now. Taking small steps to explore your interests is plenty for now."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I walked into my dorm room and my friends had decorated it for my birthday! I had no idea they were planning anything. I almost cried.", "output": "What a heartwarming surprise! It sounds like your friends really care about you and wanted to make your day special. That feeling of being seen and appreciated is so powerful. I hope you were able to soak in the moment and enjoy celebrating with people who value you so much!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I didn't get invited to the party everyone is talking about. I saw the photos on Instagram and it just made me feel so lonely and left out.", "output": "Seeing everyone having fun without you is a really stinging feeling; it’s natural to feel left out and lonely in that situation. FOMO and social exclusion can really hurt your self-esteem, but please remember that one event doesn't define your worth or your social life. It’s okay to feel sad about it tonight. Maybe you can do something kind for yourself, like watching a favorite movie?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My parents are constantly on my back about my grades. Nothing is ever good enough for them. I got a B+ and they asked why it wasn't an A. It's so suffocating.", "output": "That sounds incredibly draining. It is hurtful when your hard work isn't acknowledged and the pressure feels relentless. You are doing your best, and a B+ is a solid achievement regardless of what they say. It is important to recognize your own successes, even if your parents struggle to see them. You are more than just your grades."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I found mold in the shared bathroom again. It's so gross. My housemates are such slobs and never clean up after themselves. I feel like I'm living in a swamp.", "output": "Living in an unclean environment is really stressful and uncomfortable. It makes total sense that you feel disgusted and frustrated by the lack of hygiene from your housemates. You shouldn't have to be the only one maintaining basic cleanliness. Is it possible to create a cleaning roster so everyone shares the responsibility more fairly?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: My dad went to the hospital for some tests and I'm really scared it's something serious. I can't focus on my homework at all.", "output": "I am so sorry to hear about your dad; waiting for medical news is one of the most anxiety-inducing things we can go through. It is completely understandable that schoolwork feels impossible right now. Please be gentle with yourself and allow yourself to feel that worry. Is there a friend or family member you can sit with while you wait for news, so you aren't alone?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I finally finished my thesis paper! It took me months of all-nighters and stress, but I just hit submit. I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders.", "output": "That is a massive accomplishment! Congratulations on crossing the finish line after all that effort and dedication. The relief you are feeling is so well-deserved. Make sure to take some time to rest and recharge now that the weight is gone. You did it!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I think I'm going to try meal prepping this week. I usually just buy food on campus, but it's getting expensive. Just need to figure out some recipes.", "output": "That sounds like a practical and healthy goal! transitioning to cooking for yourself can save money and help you feel more organized. It might take a little trial and error to find recipes you like, but starting small is a great approach. Good luck with your grocery shopping!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel really ugly lately. I look in the mirror and I just hate what I see. I feel like I'll never be attractive enough for anyone to like me.", "output": "It hurts my heart to hear you talk about yourself that way. We are often our own harshest critics, pointing out flaws that others don't even see. Your worth is not defined by your appearance, though I know it feels that way sometimes. You deserve kindness and love, starting with the kindness you show yourself."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: The professor changed the due date to tomorrow without telling us! It was supposed to be next week. It's so unfair, I have work tonight and no time to finish it.", "output": "That sounds incredibly unfair and stressful! A sudden change in deadlines without proper communication throws everything into chaos. You have every right to be angry about having your schedule disrespected like that. Have you checked with other students to see if you can collectively email the professor to ask for the original deadline to be honored?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I think I'm losing my scholarship. My GPA dropped slightly below the requirement. If I lose it, I don't know how I'll pay for tuition next year.", "output": "That is a truly frightening possibility to face. Financial stress adds such a heavy layer of anxiety to college life. While the situation is scary, try to take it one step at a time. Have you spoken to the financial aid office? Sometimes there is a probation period or an appeals process for situations exactly like this."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I ran into my ex on campus today. I haven't seen him in two years. He looked so different. It really caught me off guard.", "output": "Seeing someone from your past unexpectedly can definitely be a shock to the system. It’s normal to feel a bit shaken or surprised by how much time has passed and how people change. Take a moment to center yourself if you're feeling rattled. It’s okay to feel a mix of emotions about it."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I just feel so burned out. I used to love painting, but now even looking at a canvas makes me tired. I feel like I've lost my passion.", "output": "Burnout is a very real and heavy feeling. It is heartbreaking to feel disconnected from the things that used to bring you joy. Please know that this doesn't mean your passion is gone forever; it just means your mind and body need rest right now. Give yourself permission to take a break without guilt. The creativity will wait for you."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I was on the bus and this guy kept making weird comments to me. It made me feel so slimy and unsafe. I hate that I can't just commute in peace.", "output": "I am so sorry you had to experience that. Unsolicited comments like that are harassment, and it is completely valid to feel disgusted and unsafe. You deserve to travel without being bothered or made to feel uncomfortable. It wasn't your fault, and your reaction to the situation is entirely justified."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: My dog finally learned the 'roll over' trick! We've been practicing for weeks and he finally got it. He looked so proud of himself.", "output": "That is so cute! It’s surprisingly rewarding to see a pet learn something new, especially when you’ve been practicing together. The image of him looking proud is adorable. Enjoy these fun bonding moments with your dog; they are such great stress relievers!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm considering joining the photography club. I'm not very good, but I need a hobby that gets me out of my room.", "output": "That sounds like a great idea! Clubs are about learning and community, not just about being an expert right away. Getting out of your room and exploring a creative interest could be really refreshing for you. Why not go to one meeting and see how the vibe feels?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: I can't believe my group project partners. They haven't done a single thing and the project is due in two days. I'm going to have to do it all myself.", "output": "Nothing is more frustrating than carrying the weight of a group project alone. It is completely unfair that their lack of effort is adding to your stress. You have a right to be angry about the inequity. Is it possible to speak to the instructor about the contribution breakdown, so your effort is recognized?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel like I'm the only one who hasn't found 'my group' yet. Everyone else has their cliques and I'm just floating around. It's really lonely.", "output": "Loneliness in a crowd is a very difficult feeling. It can seem like everyone else has it figured out, but many people are also looking for genuine connection. Finding your 'tribe' often takes more time than we expect. You are worthy of friendship and belonging, even if it hasn't clicked into place just yet."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: There's a flu going around the dorms and I really can't afford to get sick right now. I have finals coming up. Every time someone coughs I panic.", "output": "It is completely understandable to be anxious about your health when the timing is so critical. The pressure of finals makes everything feel higher stakes. Try to focus on the precautions you can control, like washing your hands and getting enough sleep. Your anxiety is a sign that you care about your performance, but try not to let the fear consume you."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I got an email from a professor I had last year inviting me to be a research assistant. I didn't even think she knew my name!", "output": "Wow, what a fantastic surprise! It turns out you made a much stronger impression than you realized. That is a huge compliment to your work ethic and ability. It must feel great to be recognized like that unexpectedly. Are you thinking about accepting the offer?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I cooked dinner for my roommates tonight and they actually loved it. We sat around talking for hours. It was the best night I've had in a while.", "output": "That sounds like such a lovely, wholesome evening. Sharing a meal is such a great way to bond, and it must feel good to know they enjoyed your cooking. Moments of connection like that are so important for recharging your social battery. I'm glad you had such a good night!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: My long-distance boyfriend and I broke up last night. It was mutual, but it still hurts so much. I feel like there's a hole in my chest.", "output": "I am so sorry you're going through this heartbreak. Even when a breakup is mutual, the loss of that daily connection and intimacy is incredibly painful. It’s okay to feel that emptiness right now; you are grieving a significant relationship. Be kind to yourself and give your heart the time it needs to heal."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have to confront my friend about something hurtful she said, and I'm scared she'll get mad and stop talking to me. I hate conflict.", "output": "Confrontation is really scary, especially when you value the friendship and fear losing it. It takes a lot of courage to stand up for your feelings. Remember that a healthy friendship should be able to withstand honest communication. Preparing what you want to say beforehand might help you feel a little more grounded."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I really messed up my chemistry midterm today. I studied for weeks, but when I sat down, my mind just went blank. I feel like I'm never going to pass this class.", "output": "I am so sorry to hear that your midterm didn't go the way you hoped. It is incredibly frustrating when you put in so much effort and the results don't reflect it immediately. Please try to be gentle with yourself tonight; one test does not define your intelligence or your future. Maybe you can take a little time to rest before looking at what happened with a fresh pair of eyes. You are capable, and setbacks like this happen to everyone."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have to give a presentation in front of the whole department on Thursday. Every time I think about it, my chest gets tight and I can't breathe. What if I forget everything?", "output": "It sounds like you are carrying a lot of anxiety about this presentation, and that is completely understandable. Public speaking is a very common fear, and the physical symptoms you are describing are real and valid. Try to focus on just taking one deep breath at a time right now. Remember that you have prepared for this, and it is okay to pause if you need a moment during your talk. You can get through this, one step at a time."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I stepped in a deep puddle of slush on my way to class. My sock is soaking wet and cold.", "output": "Oh no, that is one of the most uncomfortable physical sensations! Walking around with a wet, cold sock is miserable and distracting. It is completely understandable that you are feeling grossed out and annoyed by it. I hope you can find a way to dry it off or change soon, because nobody deserves wet feet all day."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: Everyone seems to be going out to parties tonight except me. I'm just sitting in my dorm room scrolling through social media feeling totally invisible. I wonder if anyone would even notice if I wasn't here.", "output": "I hear how lonely and isolated you are feeling right now, and I want to remind you that you matter. Social media often shows a highlight reel that makes us feel like everyone else is having more fun, but it isn't the full picture. It is okay to have a quiet night in, but I know it hurts to feel left out. Perhaps you could do something kind for yourself tonight, like watching a favorite movie or reading a book. You are not invisible, and your feelings are important."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: You won't believe it, but I finally got an A on my history paper! The professor even wrote a note saying my argument was original. I'm buzzing!", "output": "That is absolutely wonderful news! Congratulations on getting such a great grade and validation from your professor. It is clear that your hard work and original thinking really paid off. You deserve to celebrate this victory and feel proud of yourself. Hold onto this feeling—it is proof of what you can achieve!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I walked into the communal bathroom this morning and it was absolutely filthy. People are so gross, I don't understand how they can leave a mess like that for others to clean up.", "output": "That sounds incredibly unpleasant and I can understand why you are feeling disgusted. It is really disheartening when shared spaces aren't treated with respect. You have every right to expect a clean environment where you live. Maybe you can report it to housing maintenance so you don't have to deal with it alone. Try to get some fresh air to shake off that negative experience."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I'm graduating in two months and I still don't have a job lined up. All my friends are posting about their offers and I have nothing. I'm terrified I'm going to be a failure.", "output": "The transition out of college is a scary time, and the uncertainty you are facing is very stressful. Please try not to compare your timeline to your friends', as everyone's path looks different. You are not a failure because you haven't found the right fit yet. It is okay to take things one day at a time and keep looking without panicking. Your worth is not defined by having a job offer the moment you graduate."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I've just been feeling kind of 'meh' lately. Not super sad, but not happy either. Just going through the motions of classes and sleeping.", "output": "Thank you for sharing that with me; sometimes feeling 'meh' or numb can be confusing in its own way. It is quite common to go through phases where things feel repetitive or flat. It might be your mind's way of asking for a change of pace or just some rest. Listen to your body, and maybe try adding one small new thing to your routine to see if it sparks anything. It is okay to just be for a while."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: My boyfriend broke up with me over text this morning. We've been together for two years. I feel like my heart has been ripped out of my chest.", "output": "I am so incredibly sorry that you are going through this heartbreak. Ending a long relationship is painful enough, and the way it happened sounds very hurtful. Please give yourself permission to cry and grieve the relationship as much as you need to. You are not alone in this pain, even though it feels overwhelming right now. Be gentle with yourself in the coming days."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: I got stuck doing the entire group project by myself because everyone else flaked. Now they're all going to get the same grade as me. It's so unfair!", "output": "That is an incredibly unfair situation, and you have every right to be furious. It is frustrating to do all the heavy lifting while others coast on your hard work. Your dedication to getting the work done speaks volumes about your character, even if the grading doesn't reflect the disparity. If you feel comfortable, it might be worth mentioning the breakdown of work to your instructor. Regardless, you should be proud of your own integrity and effort."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprise\nUser: I came back to my room and my friends had decorated it for my birthday! I totally forgot it was even coming up because of exams. I was so shocked.", "output": "What a lovely surprise! It sounds like you have some really thoughtful friends who care about you. It is heartwarming to hear that they took the time to brighten your day, especially during a stressful exam period. I hope this surprise gave you a much-needed break and a smile. Happy Birthday!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: My parents are coming to visit this weekend and they are so critical of everything I do. I'm scared they're going to judge my grades and my apartment.", "output": "It is tough when family visits bring anxiety instead of comfort. It makes sense that you are worried about their judgment, but remember that you are living your own life. You have been working hard, and your value isn't determined by their approval. Try to set some boundaries for the weekend to protect your peace. You are doing your best, and that is enough."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I miss my dog back home so much. My mom sent me a picture of him sleeping on my bed and I just started crying. I hate being so far away.", "output": "Homesickness is really hard, especially when it comes to our furry friends. It is heartbreaking to see life going on without you there, but that bond you have is clearly very strong. Letting those tears out is a healthy way to process missing him. Maybe you can video call home soon to say hello to him? He definitely misses you just as much as you miss him."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: The food in the dining hall was undercooked again. I took one bite of chicken and it was pink. I feel sick just thinking about it.", "output": "That sounds really gross and unsafe; I am sorry you had that experience. Food safety is important, and it is completely natural to feel repulsed by that. I hope you were able to find something else to eat that was safe. Maybe you can grab a snack you actually enjoy later to get that taste out of your mouth. Definitely let the staff know so no one else gets sick."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I finally gathered the courage to join the hiking club, and everyone was so nice! I think I might actually make some friends here.", "output": "That is fantastic! It takes a lot of courage to put yourself out there, and I am so glad it paid off for you. Connecting with people who share your interests is a great way to build friendships. Enjoy this excitement and the new adventures ahead. You should be really proud of yourself for taking that step!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel like I'm an imposter here. Everyone else in my program is so smart and articulate, and I feel like I was let in by mistake. I'm afraid to speak up in class.", "output": "Imposter syndrome is a heavy burden to carry, and so many students feel exactly the way you do. You were accepted into your program because you have the potential and the capability to be there. Your unique perspective is valuable, even if it feels different from others'. Try to be kind to yourself and remember that everyone is learning, just like you. You belong there just as much as anyone else."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: The WiFi has gone out five times while I was trying to submit my assignment. I'm screaming internally. Why does nothing work when you need it to?", "output": "Technology issues are incredibly infuriating, especially when you are under pressure. It is completely valid to feel like screaming when things outside your control are blocking your progress. Take a deep breath; maybe you can use your phone as a hotspot or head to a library? Don't let the tech glitches ruin your whole mood, though I know it is hard right now. You will get it submitted."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I found a lump on my neck and I made the mistake of Googling it. Now I'm convinced I'm dying. I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow but I can't sleep.", "output": "Health scares are terrifying, and searching online often makes the anxiety much worse. It is good that you have an appointment tomorrow so a professional can give you real answers. Until then, try to distract yourself with something comforting and avoid looking up more symptoms. Most of the time, these things turn out to be minor. You are doing the right thing by getting it checked out."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm thinking of changing my major. I'm not upset about it, just wondering if engineering is really for me. I might prefer graphic design.", "output": "It sounds like you are in a thoughtful place of self-discovery. College is the perfect time to explore what really interests you, and changing paths is a very normal part of that. It is great that you are listening to your own preferences rather than just sticking to a plan that doesn't fit. Maybe you can take a design class to see how it feels? Trust your gut on what makes you feel engaged."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I worked all summer to save up for a trip, but my car broke down and the repairs took all my money. I'm devastated. I really needed a break.", "output": "I am so sorry that happened; it is incredibly disheartening to see your hard-earned savings disappear like that. You worked so hard for that goal, and it is unfair that life threw this wrench in your plans. Allow yourself to feel disappointed, because it is a big loss. Hopefully, you can find smaller, less expensive ways to take a break and treat yourself soon. You showed great discipline saving up, and you can do it again."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: My little sister called me today just to tell me about her day at school. It made me so happy to hear her voice. I feel recharged.", "output": "That is such a sweet moment! unexpected connections with family can really brighten up a day. It sounds like that call gave you a wonderful boost of energy and love. Holding onto these little moments of joy is so important for your well-being. I am glad you got to share that time with her."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I was on the bus and this guy kept making creepy comments at me. I moved seats but he just stared. I feel so gross and unsafe.", "output": "I am so sorry you had to experience that; it sounds incredibly uncomfortable and violating. You did the right thing by moving away and prioritizing your safety. No one deserves to be harassed or made to feel unsafe in public. Please be gentle with yourself as you shake off that creepy feeling. You are safe now."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: Walking home from the library late at night always freaks me out. The streetlights are out on my block and every shadow looks like a person.", "output": "Feeling unsafe while walking alone is a very primal and valid fear. Your safety is important, so please trust your instincts. Is there a campus shuttle or a friend you can walk with next time? For tonight, once you are safe inside, lock the door and take a moment to calm your nervous system. You navigated a scary situation and you are okay."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: It's been a month and I still haven't made a single real friend. I eat lunch alone every day. Is there something wrong with me?", "output": "There is absolutely nothing wrong with you. meaningful friendships take time to build, and the first few months can be the loneliest. Many people around you are likely feeling the same way but are hiding it. Keep being yourself and putting yourself in places where you can meet people. It will happen, even if it feels slow right now."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My professor gave me a C on my essay because he didn't agree with my opinion. I followed the rubric perfectly! He's just being biased.", "output": "That sounds incredibly frustrating and unfair. Academic work should be graded on quality and argument, not on whether the professor agrees with you. It is natural to feel angry when you feel your work hasn't been judged objectively. Maybe you can go to office hours to discuss the grading rubric specifically? Regardless, don't let this discourage you from expressing your own well-reasoned opinions."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprise\nUser: I applied for that internship I thought was a total long shot, and they actually asked for an interview! I'm in shock.", "output": "Wow, that is amazing news! It just goes to show that you are more qualified and capable than you give yourself credit for. Being selected for an interview is a huge accomplishment in itself. Take a moment to let that sink in and celebrate. Good luck with the interview—you have got this!"}

Decisions, decisions.", "output": "Planning out your schedule can be oddly satisfying, but also a bit tricky. It sounds like you are approaching it with a calm and practical mindset. Think about when you feel most alert and productive during the day. Whatever you choose, it is great that you are thinking ahead to set yourself up for success. Good luck building the perfect timetable!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I missed my best friend's birthday because I got the dates mixed up. She says it's fine, but I feel like the worst friend in the world.", "output": "Guilt is a heavy feeling, but please try to forgive yourself. We are all human and mistakes with dates happen to the best of us. The fact that you feel so bad shows how much you care about her. Since she said it is fine, try to trust her words and maybe plan a special make-up hang out. You are a good friend who made a simple mistake."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I'm barely scraping by with money this month. I have $20 to last me a week. I don't know how I'm going to eat.", "output": "Financial insecurity is incredibly stressful and frightening. It is really hard to focus on anything else when you are worried about basic needs. Please look into if your campus has a food pantry or student emergency fund—they are there for exactly this situation. You are not alone in this struggle, and there is no shame in using resources to help you get through the week."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I just finished the last exam of the semester! I feel so light, like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I'm free!", "output": "Congratulations! That feeling of freedom after a long, hard semester is unlike anything else. You have worked hard and pushed through the stress, and now you get to rest. Enjoy this lightness and take the time to do absolutely nothing if you want to. You have definitely earned this break!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I just feel so overwhelmed with all my assignments. It feels like I'm drowning and I'll never catch up no matter how hard I try.", "output": "I hear how heavy everything feels for you right now, and it’s completely understandable to feel that way when the workload piles up. It sounds incredibly exhausting to feel like you're constantly running just to stay in place. Please remember to take small breaths and be gentle with yourself; you are doing the best you can."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have a presentation tomorrow and I'm terrified. I hate public speaking and I know I'm going to freeze up in front of everyone.", "output": "It sounds like the anticipation of tomorrow is causing you a lot of anxiety, which is a very common reaction to public speaking. It’s okay to feel scared; that fear shows that you care about doing well. Try to remind yourself that your classmates are likely focused on their own presentations, and you only need to get through one moment at a time."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My roommate ate my food again without asking! I've told them a million times to stop, but they just don't respect my boundaries.", "output": "It makes total sense that you’re feeling frustrated and disrespected right now. Having your boundaries ignored, especially in your own living space, is really aggravating. Your feelings are valid, and you have every right to want your personal items and requests to be respected."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm thinking of starting a small herb garden on my balcony. Basil and mint, mostly.", "output": "That sounds like a lovely little project. Growing your own herbs is really rewarding, and they smell amazing. Plus, having fresh basil and mint for cooking or tea is a great perk. It is a nice, low-stress way to add a bit of nature to your living space."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm just spending the weekend cleaning my apartment and catching up on laundry. Nothing special happening.", "output": "It sounds like you have a productive and low-key weekend ahead of you. Sometimes those quiet days of resetting your space can be really grounding and satisfying. I hope you get everything done and find some time to relax in your clean apartment afterward."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I saw the way my friend treated the waiter at lunch today. It was so rude and entitled, I honestly wanted to disappear.", "output": "That sounds like a really uncomfortable situation to be in. It’s tough when someone we’re close to behaves in a way that clashes with our own values of kindness and respect. It’s natural to feel put off by that kind of behavior, and it speaks to your empathy that it bothered you."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: My best friend and I are drifting apart. We used to talk every day, but now I feel like I'm the only one reaching out.", "output": "I’m so sorry you’re going through this; feeling a friendship fade is a unique kind of heartache. It hurts to feel like the effort is one-sided, especially with someone who means so much to you. It’s okay to grieve the change in the relationship and to feel sad about the distance growing between you."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I'm worried about my finances. My rent went up and I don't know if I can afford to stay here next semester.", "output": "Financial uncertainty is incredibly stressful and it’s completely normal to feel anxious about your housing situation. That kind of instability hangs over everything and makes it hard to focus on anything else. I hope you can find some resources or a solution that brings you a bit more peace of mind soon."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I actually got an A on that history paper. I thought I failed it because I wrote it the night before!", "output": "Wow, what a pleasant surprise! It must be such a relief to see a great result when you were bracing for the opposite. It sounds like you might know the material better than you give yourself credit for, even under pressure!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel really lonely lately. Everyone seems to have their own cliques and I'm just on the outside looking in.", "output": "Loneliness is such a heavy and painful feeling, and I’m sorry you’re sitting with that right now. It’s really hard to feel like an observer in your own life while everyone else seems connected. Please know that your worth isn't defined by your social circle, and this season of isolation won't last forever."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My professor gave me a lower grade than I deserved. I followed the rubric exactly and he still docked points for no reason.", "output": "That sounds incredibly unfair and frustrating. When you put in the work and follow the guidelines, you expect the grading to reflect that effort accurately. It’s completely valid to feel angry when the outcome feels arbitrary or unjust."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I think I might have chosen the wrong major. I'm two years in and I don't enjoy any of my classes, but it feels too late to switch.", "output": "That is a really scary realization to face, and it makes sense that you’re feeling trapped by the time you've already invested. It’s a lot of pressure to have your future figured out right now. Just remember that your path isn't always a straight line, and acknowledging your feelings is a brave first step."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: The cafeteria food was absolutely revolting today. I literally found a hair in my pasta.", "output": "Ugh, that is an incredibly unpleasant experience. Finding something like that in your food is enough to ruin anyone's appetite and make you feel queasy. I’m sorry your meal was ruined; you definitely deserve a clean and enjoyable lunch."}

Going from expecting a bill to receiving money is the best kind of financial shock. It must feel like a weight has been lifted off your shoulders. Now you have the fun dilemma of deciding whether to save it or treat yourself to something nice!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: My roommate keeps inviting people over without asking, and I'm really anxious about confrontation. I don't want to make things awkward in the apartment, but I need my space.", "output": "It is completely understandable that you are feeling anxious about addressing this with your roommate. Your home should be a place where you feel comfortable and respected. Setting boundaries can be scary, but expressing your needs calmly is a healthy part of living together. Perhaps you can suggest a quiet time to talk when no guests are around?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: I can't believe my group project partners ghosted me right before the deadline. Now I have to do all the work myself or fail. It's so unfair!", "output": "That sounds incredibly stressful and unfair. You have every right to be angry about being left to handle the entire project alone at the last minute. It is really disappointing when others do not pull their weight. Take a deep breath and just do what you can; your professor may also be understanding if you explain the situation calmly."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: The cafeteria food has been absolutely gross lately. I found something slimy in my salad today and I almost threw up. I don't even want to eat there anymore.", "output": "That sounds really unpleasant; I am sorry you had that experience with your lunch. Finding something gross in your food is definitely enough to put anyone off their appetite. It makes sense that you would feel hesitant to eat there again right away. Maybe you can try a different dining hall or grab a snack from somewhere else for now?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I finally got the internship I applied for! I was so nervous during the interview, but they actually called me back with an offer this morning!", "output": "That is such wonderful news! Congratulations on landing the internship! It is a huge achievement, especially after feeling nervous during the process. You should be really proud of yourself for pushing through that anxiety and succeeding."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm just planning out my schedule for next semester. I'm thinking about taking an art history class as an elective, but I'm not sure if it will fit.", "output": "Planning ahead is always a smart move. Exploring an art history class sounds like a nice way to balance out your schedule with something creative. It might be worth checking the syllabus or talking to an advisor to see if the workload fits your goals."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: The smell of the garbage truck outside my window is unbearable today. It's making me nauseous.", "output": "That sounds absolutely awful. Strong, foul odors can be physically overwhelming and make it impossible to concentrate on anything else. It is totally fair to feel disgusted and want to escape the smell. Hopefully, the truck moves on quickly and you can open a window or get some fresh air soon."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have to give a presentation in my speech class tomorrow and I'm terrified. I hate public speaking and I know I'm going to freeze up and look stupid.", "output": "It is very common to feel terrified of public speaking; you are definitely not alone in that fear. The anticipation is often the hardest part. Try to remember that your classmates are likely focused on their own presentations and are not judging you. Just take it one slide at a time—you can do this."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: My parents are getting a divorce. They told me over the weekend. I know I'm in college now and 'adult', but it still hurts so much to see my family falling apart.", "output": "I am so sorry you are going through this. Just because you are in college does not mean you stop needing the stability of your family. It is completely normal to grieve the change in your family dynamic. Give yourself permission to feel sad and process this news at your own pace."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My professor gave me a C on my essay because he disagreed with my opinion, even though I backed it up with sources. He's just biased and it's driving me crazy.", "output": "It is really frustrating when you feel like your work is being graded on opinion rather than merit. You worked hard to support your arguments, so seeing that grade feels like a dismissal of your effort. That anger is valid. Maybe you could visit his office hours to discuss your sources specifically and understand his perspective better?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I'm worried about my student loans. I keep seeing the balance go up and I have no idea how I'm ever going to pay this off. It feels like I'm ruining my future.", "output": "Financial stress is incredibly heavy, and looking at those loan balances can be really scary. It is easy to feel overwhelmed when thinking about the distant future. Try to focus on the present moment—you are investing in your education, which is valuable. There will be options and plans available to you when the time comes."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: My long-distance boyfriend surprised me with a visit for the weekend! I haven't seen him in three months and I'm so excited.", "output": "That is such a sweet surprise! It must be an amazing feeling to finally see him after three months apart. I hope you have a wonderful weekend catching up and making memories together. Enjoy every moment!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I missed my little sister's birthday party because I had to work. She was crying on the phone and I feel like the worst sibling in the world.", "output": "I can hear the guilt in your voice, and it shows how much you care about your sister. Missing important moments is one of the hardest parts of being away or working. You are not a bad sibling; you are doing your best to manage your responsibilities. Maybe you can plan a special video call or a belated celebration just for the two of you?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I think I might fail this semester. I've fallen so far behind in two classes that I don't even know where to start. I'm scared to even look at the syllabus.", "output": "That feeling of paralysis when you are behind is really frightening. It is understandable that you want to avoid looking at the work because it feels so overwhelming. Just take a deep breath. Maybe start by looking at just one small assignment today? Small steps can help make the mountain look a little more climbable."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgusted\nUser: I went to a party last night and some guy wouldn't take no for an answer when I said I didn't want to dance. He was so creepy and sweaty. I feel gross just thinking about it.", "output": "I am so sorry that happened to you. You have every right to feel disgusted and violated by his behavior. No one should ever ignore your boundaries or make you feel unsafe. Please remember that his actions are a reflection of him, not you. Be kind to yourself today."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm thinking about changing my hair color. Maybe blue or purple? I've had the same style for years and I'm bored with it.", "output": "Changing up your look can be a really fun way to express yourself. Blue or purple sounds bold and exciting! Since you are feeling bored with your current style, experimenting with something new might be just the refresh you need."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel like I'm drifting apart from my high school friends. We used to talk every day, but now days go by without a text. It makes me feel like I'm losing my past.", "output": "It is really painful to feel that distance growing with old friends. It is a natural part of growing up, but that does not make it hurt any less. It feels like grieving a loss. Try to cherish the memories you have, and remember that friendships can ebb and flow without disappearing completely."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: The internet in my dorm has been down for three hours and I have an online quiz due at midnight! IT support isn't answering. I am going to explode.", "output": "That is an incredibly stressful situation! It is completely reasonable to be angry when technical issues threaten your grades. The helplessness of waiting on IT support is the worst. Is there a library or a coffee shop nearby with wifi where you could go as a backup plan?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm just organizing my digital files today. Cleaning up my desktop and sorting photos.", "output": "That sounds like a very satisfying task. Digital clutter can be just as stressful as physical clutter, so getting it organized often feels like a mental cleanse. It is nice to get everything in its right place. I bet your computer will feel much lighter to use when you are done."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I just finished my last final exam! I am officially done with my sophomore year. I feel so light and free.", "output": "Congratulations! That feeling of freedom after a tough semester is the best. You worked hard to get here, and now you can finally relax and breathe. Enjoy your well-deserved break!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel really ugly today. I look at everyone on Instagram and they're all so perfect, and I just look like a mess. I hate my body.", "output": "I am so sorry you are struggling with your self-image today. Social media can be such a thief of joy, showing us curated highlights that make us feel inadequate. Please remember that you are seeing their filters, not their reality. You are worthy and valuable exactly as you are, regardless of what the screen says."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: My lab partner picks his nose when he thinks no one is looking and then touches the equipment. It makes me want to gag.", "output": "That sounds incredibly unhygienic and it is totally normal that you are grossed out. Shared spaces require basic manners, and it is hard to focus when you are uncomfortable. Make sure to wash your hands frequently, and maybe use sanitizer on the equipment before you start working if you can."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I'm graduating in a month and I still don't have a job lined up. Everyone asks me 'what's next?' and I want to scream. What if I have to move back home forever?", "output": "The pressure to have everything figured out right at graduation is immense. It is very common to not have a job secured yet, even if it feels like everyone else does. 'Forever' is a long time—moving home might just be a temporary stepping stone. You have time to figure this out."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My friend borrowed my favorite jacket and returned it with a huge stain on it without even apologizing. She acted like it was no big deal!", "output": "That is really disrespectful of your property and your friendship. It is not just about the jacket; it is about the lack of accountability and apology. You have a right to be angry. It might be worth telling her calmly how much that hurt you, so she understands it is a big deal to you."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I need to go grocery shopping later. I'm trying to decide if I should meal prep for the week or just buy frozen dinners again.", "output": "Deciding on food for the week is a constant chore. Meal prepping can save money and be healthier, but frozen dinners are definitely convenient when you are busy. Maybe you could do a mix of both so you are not overwhelmed?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I just realized I missed the deadline to drop a class. Now I'm stuck in it and I know I'm going to fail. I'm such an idiot.", "output": "Please be kind to yourself; making a mistake with a deadline does not make you an idiot. It is a stressful oversight, and it hurts to feel trapped in a class you wanted to leave. Is there any way to talk to the registrar or the professor to see if there are any emergency withdrawal options?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I baked cookies for my floor mates and everyone loved them! We ended up hanging out in the hallway for hours just talking and eating.", "output": "That sounds like such a wholesome and happy memory! Sharing food is a wonderful way to bring people together. It is great that your gesture turned into a fun night of connection. Those hallway hangouts are often the best part of dorm life."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: There's a rumor going around that I cheated on the last exam. I didn't, but I'm scared the professor will believe it. My reputation is ruined.", "output": "It is terrifying to be accused of something you did not do, especially when your academic reputation is on the line. Gossip can feel overwhelming. Try to hold your head high knowing the truth. If the professor does ask, just be honest and calm; the truth is on your side."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I'm homesick. I miss my dog so much. Facetiming my parents isn't the same as cuddling him.", "output": "Missing a pet is a unique kind of heartache. They give us such comfort and love, and a screen just cannot replace a cuddle. It is okay to cry and miss him. Maybe looking at photos or videos of him can bring a little bit of comfort until you can see him again."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: I hold the door open for people all the time and no one ever says thank you. It's such a small thing but it makes me so mad that people are so rude.", "output": "It is the little discourtesies that can really wear us down sometimes. You are making an effort to be polite, and it feels like a slap in the face when it is not acknowledged. Your anger is valid—it is frustrating when basic kindness isn't reciprocated. Keep being the kind person you are; it matters, even if they don't say it."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel like I'm drowning in my coursework. Every time I finish one assignment, three more pop up. I just can't catch a break and I'm exhausted.", "output": "It sounds like you are carrying a really heavy load right now, and it makes total sense that you're feeling exhausted. It can be incredibly draining when it feels like the finish line keeps moving further away. Please remember to be gentle with yourself; you are doing the best you can in a tough situation. sometimes taking a tiny break to just breathe can help reset things, even if the work is still there."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have to give a presentation tomorrow and I'm terrified. My hands shake whenever I speak in public, and I'm scared I'm going to embarrass myself in front of everyone.", "output": "That sounds like a really nerve-wracking situation, and it’s completely normal to feel scared about public speaking. Many people feel that same shake in their hands, so you are definitely not alone in this. Try to focus on your breathing if the nerves start to rise; sometimes grounding yourself in the moment helps. No matter what happens, your worth isn't defined by this one presentation, and you might be stronger than you think."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I finally nailed that difficult chord progression on my guitar! My fingers hurt but I'm grinning.", "output": "That is awesome! There is no feeling quite like the breakthrough when muscle memory finally clicks. The sore fingers are just a badge of honor for your hard work and practice. Keep playing it; you have earned that grin and the music you are making!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I finally got an A on my chemistry test! I studied so hard for weeks, and it actually paid off. I'm beaming right now.", "output": "That is absolutely wonderful news! It is so rewarding to see all that hard work and dedication turn into such a great result. You should be really proud of yourself for sticking with it and putting in the effort. Make sure to take a little time to celebrate this victory—you earned it!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: My best friend hasn't texted me back in three days. I feel like I did something wrong, but I don't know what. It hurts to be ignored.", "output": "I can hear how hurt and confused you are feeling right now; the silence can be really loud and unsettling. It’s easy to blame yourself when things go quiet, but try not to jump to conclusions just yet. They might just be overwhelmed with their own life, and it doesn't necessarily reflect on your worth as a friend. Hang in there, and hopefully, clarity will come soon."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel really unmotivated lately. I have things to do but I just want to lay in bed and stare at the ceiling.", "output": "That heaviness and lack of motivation can be really hard to fight against. It sounds like you might be burnt out or just need a period of rest. Please don't beat yourself up for needing downtime; sometimes doing 'nothing' is exactly what your brain needs to reset. Try to do just one tiny thing if you can, but if not, just resting is okay too."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: Just wondering if I should take a gap year or go straight to college. Everyone has a different opinion and I'm just listing out pros and cons.", "output": "That is a big decision to weigh, and it’s smart of you to take the time to list out the pros and cons. It can be confusing when everyone around you is offering different advice. Ultimately, this path is yours to walk, so listening to your own gut is just as important as the logic. Whatever you choose, know that there isn't just one 'right' way to do life."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: My parents are fighting a lot lately. I can hear them shouting through the walls and I'm scared they might get divorced. I don't know what to do.", "output": "I am so sorry you are going through this; feeling unsafe or unstable at home is incredibly scary. It makes sense that you feel helpless when the conflict is happening around you. Remember that their relationship issues are not your fault and not your responsibility to fix. Is there a quiet place, like a library or a friend's house, where you can go to get some peace when things get loud?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I didn't get the internship I wanted. I feel like a failure. Everyone else seems to be moving forward while I'm stuck.", "output": "It’s heartbreaking to get a rejection when you wanted something so badly. Feeling stuck while watching others move forward is a really painful experience, but please know this one 'no' does not define your future. You are not a failure; you are just on a different timeline, and that is okay. Be kind to yourself while you process this disappointment."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprise\nUser: I just found out I was nominated for class president! I never thought anyone noticed the work I was doing for the student council.", "output": "What an amazing surprise! It sounds like your hard work has been making a real impact, even when you thought no one was watching. It is a great feeling to be recognized and validated by your peers like that. Soak in this moment—it is a testament to your dedication and character."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel so lonely lately. I'm surrounded by people on campus, but I feel like I don't really connect with anyone deeply.", "output": "That is a very profound and difficult kind of loneliness—feeling alone in a crowd. It’s okay to feel this way, and actually, many people feel the same, even if they don't show it. deeply connecting takes time and vulnerability, which isn't easy. Maybe starting with one small, shared interest club could be a gentle way to find your tribe."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I'm worried about money. My part-time job hours got cut, and I don't know how I'm going to pay for textbooks next semester.", "output": "Financial stress is incredibly heavy and it touches every part of your life, so it’s natural to feel worried. The uncertainty of how to make ends meet is really frightening. Have you checked if your school has any student aid or emergency funds available? You are showing a lot of resilience just by looking for solutions, and I hope things stabilize for you soon."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My professor gave me a C on a paper I worked on for weeks. His feedback made no sense and contradicted the rubric. It's so unfair!", "output": "It is incredibly frustrating to feel like your hard work wasn't graded fairly, especially when the feedback is confusing. You have a right to feel angry when the rules seem to change without warning. Once the initial heat of the anger cools, maybe you could visit office hours to ask for clarification? Regardless, that grade does not reflect your intelligence or your effort."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I look in the mirror and I hate what I see. I feel like I'm never going to be attractive enough or good enough.", "output": "It hurts my heart to hear you talk about yourself that way, but I appreciate you sharing your feelings. Struggling with self-image is a really painful battle, and it’s hard when that inner voice is so critical. Please try to remember that your worth is so much more than your reflection. You deserve kindness and acceptance, especially from yourself."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: My older brother just told me he's proud of me. We don't usually talk about feelings, so it meant a lot.", "output": "That sounds like a really special and touching moment between you and your brother. Hearing those words from someone you look up to can be so validating. It’s lovely that you were able to share that connection. Hold onto that feeling; it sounds like a beautiful strengthening of your bond."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: The cafeteria food was literally moldy today. I almost threw up. I can't believe we pay so much for this meal plan.", "output": "That sounds absolutely revolting, and your reaction is completely justified. It is really disappointing and unacceptable when the services you pay for fail so badly, especially regarding health and safety. You definitely deserve fresh, safe food. It might be worth reporting this to student services so it doesn't happen to anyone else."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I think I'm losing my passion for my major. What if I chose the wrong path? I'm three years in and I'm scared it's too late to change.", "output": "That is a really big and scary question to face, especially after investing so much time. It’s common to have doubts as reality sets in, but it doesn't necessarily mean you've made a mistake. Sometimes burnout looks like a loss of passion. Even if you do decide to pivot, skills are often transferable, and it is never truly 'too late' to find what lights you up."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My internet cut out right in the middle of an important video call. I looked so incompetent.", "output": "That is a technical nightmare! It is so frustrating when technology fails us at the most critical moments. Please try not to blame yourself; everyone knows these things happen and it doesn't reflect on your competence. It is just bad luck, but that doesn't make it any less annoying in the moment. Take a breath; you can explain what happened via email."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm just planning my schedule for next week. Trying to fit in gym, study, and work. It's a puzzle.", "output": "It sounds like you are in full organization mode, which is a great way to handle a busy life. Balancing all those different responsibilities is definitely a puzzle! It is impressive that you are prioritizing your health and studies alongside work. Don't forget to schedule in a little downtime for yourself too—you'll need it to recharge."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My parents are pressuring me to come home every weekend. They don't understand that I need to build my own life here. It's suffocating.", "output": "It sounds really stifling to feel that pressure when you are trying to establish your independence. It is completely normal to want space to grow and build your own community. You aren't wrong for wanting weekends to yourself. Setting boundaries with family is hard, but it’s an important part of becoming an adult."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: There's a flu going around the dorms and I have a compromised immune system. I'm terrified of getting sick and failing my classes.", "output": "That is a very valid fear, and it’s stressful to feel like your health is under threat in your own living space. Your well-being is the most important thing. Is it possible to reach out to your professors or disability services proactively to let them know the situation? Taking precautions is smart, but try not to let the worry consume you entirely."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I tried to organize a movie night and nobody showed up. I bought snacks and everything. I feel so stupid.", "output": "Oh, that is such a painful experience, and I am sending you a virtual hug. You are not stupid for trying to bring people together; that shows you have a generous and welcoming heart. It hurts when that effort isn't returned, but please don't let this one event close you off. You deserve friends who show up for you."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I just had the best conversation with a stranger at the coffee shop. We talked about philosophy for an hour. It was so refreshing!", "output": "That sounds like such a delightful and unexpected connection! It is amazing how a good conversation can energize you and make the world feel a little brighter. spontaneous moments like that are really special. I'm so glad you got to experience that intellectual spark today."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have to confront my friend about a lie they told me. I hate conflict and my stomach is in knots just thinking about it.", "output": "Confrontation is really difficult, especially with someone you care about, so your anxiety is totally understandable. It shows that you value the truth and the friendship enough to want to clear the air. Try to approach it with 'I' statements to keep things calm. No matter how it goes, be proud of yourself for being brave enough to address it."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I found out my ex has been spreading rumors about me. It's so petty and gross. I can't believe I ever dated them.", "output": "That is incredibly disrespectful and immature behavior, and it makes total sense that you feel disgusted by it. It’s painful to see someone you used to care about act with such malice. You are taking the high road by recognizing how petty it is. Focus on the people who know the real you; the rumors don't define your truth."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: It's my birthday today and I'm spending it alone in my dorm. I miss my family and my old friends.", "output": "Happy Birthday! I know it probably doesn't feel very happy right now, and it is completely okay to feel sad and homesick on special days. Spending a birthday alone can feel really isolating. Maybe you can do something small just for you, like ordering your favorite food or watching a comfort movie? You are celebrated and important, even from afar."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprise\nUser: I just realized I've been reading the wrong chapters for the exam. The syllabus changed and I didn't check my email!", "output": "Oh wow, that is definitely a shock to the system! It is a sinking feeling when you realize a mistake like that, but try not to panic. Now that you know, you can adjust your plan. Is there enough time to skim the correct chapters or get notes from a classmate? You can recover from this."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I found a weird charge on my credit card statement. I'm worried my identity has been stolen.", "output": "That is a stomach-dropping feeling. Financial security is so important, and the threat of identity theft is really scary. The good news is you caught it. Call your bank immediately; they are usually very good at handling this and protecting you. You are taking the right steps, but it is totally normal to feel shaken by the violation."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm trying to decide if I should pick up a minor in Spanish or Psychology. Both seem useful.", "output": "That is a good dilemma to have! Both of those fields offer great skills that complement almost any major. Maybe think about which classes excite you more when you read the descriptions? Trust your curiosity; you usually learn best when you're genuinely interested in the subject matter."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I'm walking home alone tonight and it's really dark. I feel unsafe.", "output": "Your safety is the top priority right now. Please stay alert and stick to well-lit areas if you can. If you have a phone, maybe call a friend or family member to stay on the line with you until you get inside. If your campus has a safety escort service or a blue light system, don't hesitate to use them. Trust your instincts."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel like I'm drowning in coursework and everyone else seems to be managing just fine. I tried to study all night, but I just ended up staring at the wall.", "output": "I hear how overwhelmed you are right now, and that feeling of drowning is incredibly heavy. It's completely understandable to feel stuck when the pressure mounts like that. Please remember that comparing your inside struggles to everyone else's outside appearances can be misleading; many people are struggling silently too. Be gentle with yourself today—maybe try breaking just one small task into tiny pieces. You don't have to do it all at once."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: My presentation is tomorrow and I'm terrified I'm going to freeze up. My hands won't stop shaking every time I think about standing in front of the class.", "output": "It sounds like your anxiety is running really high right now, and that physical reaction is a very normal response to fear. Standing up in front of people can be so daunting, and worrying about freezing up makes it even harder. Take a moment to just breathe deeply and acknowledge that feeling scared doesn't mean you aren't capable. Even if your voice shakes, your ideas are worth hearing. You've prepared for this, and you can get through it one minute at a time."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: My plant that looked dead for months suddenly sprouted a new leaf! I had given up on it.", "output": "That is a little miracle of nature! It is so surprising and hopeful when life finds a way to come back just when we have accepted defeat. It sounds like your plant is a survivor. It must be really satisfying to see that pop of green again. Keep doing whatever you are doing!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I finally got a callback for that internship I applied for last month! I was so sure they forgot about me.", "output": "That is such wonderful news! It must feel like a huge weight has been lifted off your shoulders after waiting for so long. Getting recognition for your hard work and patience is a great feeling. Take some time to celebrate this win, no matter how small the celebration might be. You earned this opportunity!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: My best friend has been ignoring my texts for three days. I don't know what I did wrong, and I feel so lonely without talking to them.", "output": "The silence from someone you care about can be so painful and confusing. It's natural for your mind to jump to the worst-case scenario and blame yourself, but try not to assume the worst just yet. Feeling lonely when you're disconnected from your support system is a very real and valid ache. Give it a little time, and remember that their silence might be about something going on in their life, not necessarily something you did. Hang in there."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I overheard some people in the library making fun of a first-year student's clothes. It was so mean and unnecessary, I felt sick just listening to it.", "output": "It is really upsetting to witness unkindness like that, and your reaction shows how much you value empathy and respect. Feeling disgusted by bullying is a sign of your own integrity and kindness. It's hard to sit with that icky feeling when you see people behaving cruelly. Remind yourself that their behavior reflects on them, not on the person they were targeting. Holding onto your own values is the best way to counter that kind of negativity."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm not really sure how I feel today. Just kind of going through the motions, waking up, going to class, coming home.", "output": "It sounds like you're experiencing a bit of a numbness or routine fatigue today. Sometimes days just feel like a checklist we have to get through, and that's okay. You don't have to be happy or productive all the time; just existing is enough. Maybe try to find one small sensory thing today, like a warm drink or a nice song, to ground you. It's okay to just coast for a while until you feel more like yourself."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I'm worried my parents are going to get a divorce. They've been fighting every night and the tension in the house is unbearable.", "output": "Living in a home filled with tension and conflict is incredibly draining and scary. It makes sense that you're feeling fearful about the future of your family; uncertainty is one of the hardest things to deal with. Please know that their relationship issues are not your fault and not your burden to fix. Whatever happens, your safety and well-being matter. Try to find a safe space, maybe outside the house or in your room with headphones, to give yourself a break from the noise."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel like I'm not good at anything. Everyone in my art class is so talented and my work looks like a child did it.", "output": "It hurts so much when we compare our own progress to the finished work of others. Feeling inadequate is a heavy emotion to carry, especially when you're trying to express yourself creatively. Remember that everyone starts somewhere, and your unique perspective is what makes art special, not just technical perfection. Be kind to yourself as you learn; growth happens slowly. You are worthy and talented in ways you might not be seeing right now."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: The professor changed the grading criteria the day before the final project is due! It's so unfair, I spent weeks working on the old rubric.", "output": "That sounds incredibly unfair and frustrating! It's completely valid to feel angry when the goalposts are moved at the last minute after you've put in so much effort. You have a right to expect consistency and clarity in your education. Take a moment to vent that frustration safely so it doesn't consume you. If you can, maybe reach out to classmates to see if you can approach the professor together, but for now, just acknowledging that this situation sucks is important."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I actually passed my calculus midterm! I was 100% sure I failed it, I didn't even finish the last question.", "output": "Wow, what a relief that must be! It's a great reminder that sometimes our internal critic judges us much more harshly than reality does. Being pleasantly surprised like this is such a nice boost. It shows that you probably know more than you give yourself credit for. Congratulations on getting through a tough exam!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I miss my dog so much. Being away at college is harder than I thought it would be without him sleeping at the foot of my bed.", "output": "Homesickness often hits hardest when we miss the unconditional love of our pets. It's so hard to adjust to a quiet room when you're used to that comforting presence. Your grief for that companionship is very real and it's okay to cry about it. Maybe looking at photos or video chatting with your family to see him could help a little. You aren't alone in feeling this way; many students find the separation from pets the hardest part."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have to tell my parents I want to change my major from Pre-Med to English. I'm so scared they're going to cut me off financially.", "output": "That is a massive and scary conversation to have, especially when financial security is tied to it. The fear of disappointing your parents while trying to be true to yourself is a very difficult conflict to navigate. It's brave of you to recognize what you actually want to pursue. Before you talk to them, maybe prepare what you want to say and try to anticipate their concerns. Regardless of their reaction, your happiness and career path are yours to choose."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: My roommate and I stayed up until 3am just talking and laughing about nothing. It's the first time I've felt like I really made a friend here.", "output": "That sounds like such a heartwarming and special moment! those late-night conversations are often where the best bonds are built. It's wonderful that you're feeling that sense of connection and belonging. Cherish that feeling of being understood and having fun effortlessly. It sounds like the start of a lovely friendship."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel so ugly today. I looked in the mirror and just hated everything I saw. I don't want to leave my room.", "output": "I'm so sorry you're having such a tough body image day; those days can feel incredibly isolating and painful. It's really hard when our own minds turn against us like that. Please try to treat yourself with the same kindness you would offer a friend who felt this way. You are more than your reflection, and your worth isn't defined by how you look in the mirror. If you need to stay in and take care of yourself today, that is okay."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: My lab partner hasn't showered in days and keeps getting too close to me. It's really making it hard to focus on the work.", "output": "That sounds like a very uncomfortable and awkward situation to be in. It's difficult to focus on your work when your physical space feels invaded or uncomfortable. Your reaction is a natural physical response to hygiene issues. If you can, try to create a bit of physical distance subtly, or perhaps focus on completing the work as quickly as possible. You have a right to your personal space."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: Just finished my last class for the week. Now I have the whole weekend ahead of me and nothing planned.", "output": "That creates a nice, open space for you to decide what you need. Sometimes having no plans is a luxury, and other times it can feel a bit aimless. It's perfectly fine to just see where the weekend takes you without an agenda. Whether you choose to rest, explore, or catch up on life, try to enjoy the freedom of the next two days. Relaxing is a valid use of time too."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I saw my ex with someone new today at the coffee shop. It's been six months, but it still hurt like it happened yesterday.", "output": "Seeing an ex with someone else can be a real shock to the system, no matter how much time has passed. Healing isn't linear, and it's completely normal for that sight to reopen old wounds. It doesn't mean you haven't made progress; it just means you're human and you cared. Be gentle with yourself today and allow yourself to feel that sadness without judgment. You will get through this wave of emotion just like you've gotten through the others."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I'm walking home alone and it's dark. I know this neighborhood is safe, but I just have this bad feeling.", "output": "It is completely valid to listen to your instincts when you feel unsafe. Your safety is the most important thing, so please stay alert and stick to well-lit areas if you can. If it helps, maybe call a friend or family member to stay on the phone with you until you get home. Don't worry about being 'silly'—trusting your gut is smart. Get home safe."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: I put so much effort into that group project and the other two members did absolutely nothing. We all got the same grade. I'm fuming.", "output": "That is infuriating! It is so unjust to carry the workload for others and not have that effort recognized individually. Group projects can be one of the most stressful parts of school for exactly this reason. Your anger is a signal that your time and effort weren't respected. While the grade is recorded, you know the truth of your hard work and work ethic, which will serve you well in the long run. Venting about it is definitely necessary right now."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I haven't been sleeping well lately. I just lie there worrying about the future, and the next day I'm too tired to function.", "output": "Insomnia caused by anxiety is a vicious cycle that leaves you feeling drained and vulnerable. It's so hard to face the day when your mind wouldn't let you rest at night. Please know that you aren't failing because you're tired; you're running a marathon without rest. Try to be compassionate with your energy levels today—do the bare minimum if that's what you need. If this keeps happening, looking into some sleep hygiene or talking to a counselor might help quiet those nighttime worries."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I watched a documentary about factory farming and now I can't look at meat without feeling sick.", "output": "It is really jarring to see the reality behind where our food comes from. Once you have that knowledge and those images in your head, it is hard to unsee them. That physical reaction of disgust is your empathy kicking in. It is okay if your eating habits change for a while or forever because of this; listen to what your body and conscience are telling you."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm going to the library to return some books. Might browse the new releases while I'm there.", "output": "That sounds like a pleasant errand. Libraries have such a calming atmosphere. Browsing the new releases is always a bit of a treasure hunt; you never know what story might catch your eye. I hope you find something interesting to take home with you."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: My grandmother is in the hospital and I can't afford a ticket to go fly and see her. I feel like a terrible grandchild.", "output": "You are not a terrible grandchild; you are a student in a difficult financial situation who loves their grandmother very much. Guilt is a heavy addition to the sadness you're already feeling, but please try to release it. Your love for her isn't measured by a plane ticket. Maybe you can call her or write her a letter? She would want you to be kind to yourself, not beating yourself up over things you can't control."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: The communal kitchen is a disaster. There is moldy food in the fridge and dirty dishes piled high. It smells awful.", "output": "Living in filth that isn't your fault is incredibly demoralizing and gross. It's hard to feel comfortable or want to cook when your environment is so unsanitary. Your disgust is a healthy reaction to an unhealthy environment. It's unfair that you have to deal with this. Maybe you can speak to an RA or organize a cleaning roster, but for now, just validating that it is indeed gross is important."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My parents keep comparing me to my older brother who is already a lawyer. I'm trying my best in my own path but it's never enough for them.", "output": "That is so hurtful and damaging. You are your own person with your own unique path, and you deserve to be celebrated for who you are, not compared to someone else. It makes total sense that you're angry; constant comparison erodes self-esteem. Your best IS enough. Keep following your own interests and try to define success on your own terms, even if they don't see it yet."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel like I don't fit in here. Everyone seems so wealthy and sophisticated, and I feel like a fraud.", "output": "Imposter syndrome combined with cultural or class differences can feel incredibly lonely. It's a heavy burden to feel like you have to hide who you are or that you don't belong. Please remember that you earned your spot there just as much as anyone else. Your background gives you a unique perspective that is valuable. You aren't a fraud; you are navigating a new and challenging environment, and that takes courage."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I finally finished writing the first chapter of my novel! I've been talking about doing this for years.", "output": "Congratulations! That is a huge milestone. Turning an idea into reality takes so much discipline and creativity. You should be incredibly proud of yourself for following through on your dream. Keep that momentum going, but also take a moment to just bask in the satisfaction of having created something that didn't exist before."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have a lump in my neck. I Googled it and now I'm convinced I'm dying. I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow but I can't sleep.", "output": "Health anxiety is terrifying, and the internet often makes it so much worse by showing us the worst-case scenarios. It is agonizing to wait for an appointment when your mind is racing with fear. Try to remind yourself that 'Googling' is not a diagnosis and that there are many minor reasons for physical changes too. You have done the right thing by booking an appointment. Try to distract yourself tonight with a comfort show or book; worrying won't change the outcome, but it will exhaust you."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I spent the whole day cleaning my apartment. It's not fun, but it looks better now.", "output": "There is a quiet satisfaction in getting things in order. It might not be 'fun,' but creating a clean space is a great way to care for your future self. A tidy environment can often help your mind feel a little clearer too. It sounds like a productive day, even if it was just chores. Enjoy your clean apartment!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel like I'm failing all my classes even though I study constantly. It's just not clicking.", "output": "I hear how frustrated and drained you are feeling right now. Putting in so much effort without seeing the results you want is incredibly discouraging. Please be gentle with yourself; grades don't define your worth, and this struggle doesn't mean you aren't capable."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have a presentation tomorrow and I'm terrified. My hands shake whenever I have to speak in public.", "output": "It is completely normal to feel that anxiety before a presentation; public speaking is a common fear for so many people. Try to take some deep, slow breaths to ground yourself. Remember, you have prepared for this, and your classmates are likely more focused on their own work than judging you."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: My roommate finally agreed to a cleaning schedule! I'm so relieved.", "output": "That is fantastic news! It sounds like a huge weight has been lifted off your shoulders. Open communication can be tough, so good for you for sticking with it and finding a solution that works for your home."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My group project partner ghosted us two days before the deadline. Now I have to do all their work.", "output": "That sounds incredibly unfair and frustrating. It makes total sense that you feel angry about being left with all that responsibility at the last minute. Make sure to document what happened, but for now, just focus on doing what you can without burning yourself out."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I don't really have much going on this weekend. Just planning to catch up on sleep.", "output": "A quiet weekend sounds like a great way to recharge. Catching up on sleep is so important for your well-being. I hope you enjoy the downtime and wake up feeling refreshed."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: The cafeteria food was absolutely gross today. It looked like it had been sitting out for hours.", "output": "Ugh, that sounds really unappealing. There is nothing worse than looking forward to a meal and finding it inedible. Hopefully, you can find a better snack later to make up for it!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: My best friend from high school stopped replying to my texts. I think we're drifting apart.", "output": "It is really painful to feel a close friendship fading, especially one with so much history. It's okay to grieve that connection. Sometimes growing apart happens, but it doesn't erase the good memories you shared or mean you did anything wrong."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I'm graduating in two months and I have no job lined up. I feel like I'm going to end up homeless.", "output": "The uncertainty of life after graduation is incredibly scary, and your feelings are valid. However, try to remember that very few people have everything figured out instantly. You have time to find your path, and taking small steps now is better than letting the panic paralyze you."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I actually got an A on that chem midterm. I thought I failed it for sure!", "output": "Wow, what a wonderful surprise! You must be so proud of yourself for exceeding your own expectations. It just goes to show that you might be absorbing more than you realize. Congratulations!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: My little niece drew a picture of me and said I'm her favorite aunt. My heart melted.", "output": "That is the absolute sweetest thing! Being loved by a child is such a pure and honest form of affection. It is wonderful that you have such a special bond with her. Keep that picture safe; it is a tangible reminder of how much you matter to her."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My parents keep asking when I'm going to get a 'real' boyfriend. It's so annoying.", "output": "It sounds really exhausting to deal with that kind of pressure constantly. You have every right to be annoyed when your boundaries or choices aren't being respected. Your relationship status is your business, and you are enough just as you are."}

{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: Everyone seems to be partying and making friends except me. I'm scared I'll be alone for all four years.", "output": "Loneliness in college is much more common than it looks on social media, but that doesn't make it feel any less scary. You are not destined to be alone forever. Friendships often take time to build, so try to be patient with yourself as you navigate this new environment."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: My lab partner keeps picking their nose when the TA isn't looking. It makes me want to puke.", "output": "That sounds really unpleasant to have to witness while you are trying to work! It is totally understandable that you are grossed out. Maybe try to focus entirely on your equipment or notes to distract yourself from them."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I just feel heavy today. I don't want to get out of bed.", "output": "I'm sorry you're having such a heavy day. Sometimes our bodies and minds just need a pause. If you can, try to do just one small thing, even if it's just sitting up or drinking water, but be kind to yourself if you need to rest."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: The professor changed the syllabus halfway through the semester and added a huge paper. It's ridiculous.", "output": "That sounds incredibly frustrating and disorganized. It is really unfair to have the expectations shifted on you like that when you were already planning your workload. You are totally justified in feeling angry about the extra stress this causes."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: My dog back home recognized me on FaceTime! He started wagging his tail.", "output": "Aww, that is the sweetest thing! It is so heartwarming to know your bond with him is still so strong. Those little moments of connection with our pets can really brighten up the whole day."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: My crush actually sat next to me in lecture today. I didn't know what to do.", "output": "That must have been a heart-pounding moment! It is a fun surprise, even if it made you a little nervous. Just take a deep breath; it’s a nice sign that they feel comfortable around you."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I didn't get invited to the party everyone is talking about. I feel so left out and invisible.", "output": "Being excluded stings deeply; it taps into a very primal fear of not belonging. It is incredibly painful to hear everyone discussing something you weren't part of. Please remember that their oversight does not define your value. You are seen and you matter, even if this particular group failed to show it this time. Treat yourself with extra kindness tonight."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel so ugly lately. I look in the mirror and just want to cry.", "output": "I am so sorry you are struggling with your self-image right now. It is painful when we can't see our own beauty or worth. Please remember that your appearance is the least interesting thing about you, and you are deserving of love and kindness, especially from yourself."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm thinking about cooking pasta for dinner. Not sure what sauce to use though.", "output": "Pasta is always a solid comfort food choice. Maybe you can check what ingredients you have on hand to decide on the sauce? Whatever you choose, I hope you enjoy a nice, warm meal."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: Someone stole my laundry detergent. Who does that?!", "output": "That is so rude and violating! It is maddening when people don't respect personal property, especially with something as basic as laundry supplies. It makes total sense that you are upset."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I stepped in a deep puddle on the way to class and now my socks are wet.", "output": "Oh no, wet socks are the absolute worst feeling!

I'm scared they're going to get divorced.", "output": "I am so sorry you are carrying that worry; family conflict is incredibly destabilizing.

{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: The internet cut out right while I was submitting my quiz. I might get a zero.", "output": "That is an absolute nightmare scenario!

I feel like I'm never going to get into med school now.", "output": "I'm so sorry to hear about your exam; it's incredibly frustrating when your hard work doesn't immediately pay off. One test doesn't define your entire future or your ability to succeed in medicine. Be gentle with yourself tonight, maybe do something relaxing to take your mind off it, and remember that setbacks happen to everyone."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: I lent my favorite book to a friend and she returned it with the cover ripped and coffee stains on the pages.", "output": "Oh, that is heartbreaking and infuriating! Books are precious, and when you share something you love, you expect it to be treated with respect. It feels like a violation of your trust and your property. It is completely valid to be upset and to hesitate before lending her anything again. I hope you can maybe tape it up, but the damage is done and that sucks."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My roommate ate my leftovers again! I explicitly wrote my name on the container. It’s so disrespectful and I'm sick of being the only one who respects boundaries.", "output": "That sounds really annoying, and you have every right to be upset about your boundaries being crossed. It’s tough when you feel like you're the only one putting in the effort to be considerate. Maybe when you're feeling a bit calmer, you can have a direct conversation about how important this is to you."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I finally got the internship I applied for! I was so sure I bombed the interview, but they called me this morning with an offer.", "output": "That is absolutely wonderful news!

The sound of the drill terrifies me.", "output": "Dental anxiety is extremely common, and that sound is a huge trigger for many people. You are definitely not alone in this fear. Maybe you can bring headphones and listen to loud music or a podcast to block out the noise? Let the dentist know you are anxious; they can often take breaks or help you feel more comfortable. You will get through this."}

I don't know what I did wrong.", "output": "It hurts so much to feel a distance grow in a close friendship, especially when you aren't sure why. Please try not to blame yourself immediately; they might be going through something they haven't shared yet. It’s okay to feel sad about the silence, but remember you are worthy of connection and communication."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: Just finished my classes for the day. Now I'm sitting in the library trying to decide if I should start my essay or just go watch a movie.", "output": "It sounds like a pretty typical dilemma after a long day of classes. Listening to what your brain needs right now is important—if you're burnt out, a movie might recharge you better than forcing the essay. Whatever you choose, make sure it feels right for you at this moment."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I ran into my ex at the coffee shop today. I thought it would be awkward, but we actually had a nice, short chat.

Sometimes time really does help soften things."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: My parents are arguing really loudly downstairs again. I hate it when they fight. I'm hiding in my room with headphones on but I can still hear them.", "output": "I'm so sorry you're dealing with that environment right now; it’s really scary and draining to be around constant conflict. Putting on your headphones is a good coping strategy to protect your peace. Please remember that their arguments are not your fault and it’s okay to prioritize your own safety and comfort."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel so lonely on campus. Everyone seems to have their own cliques already, and I'm just eating lunch alone every day. I miss home.", "output": "Loneliness in a new environment is such a heavy feeling, and it’s very common even if it looks like everyone else is connected. Eating alone doesn't mean there is anything wrong with you; building a community takes time. Be patient with yourself, and know that your people are out there, you just haven't met them yet."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: The professor changed the due date to tomorrow without even emailing us! It was supposed to be next week. This is so unfair.", "output": "That is incredibly frustrating and unfair to spring on you like that. It makes total sense that you’re angry about the sudden lack of time and communication. Take a deep breath, do what you can, and maybe check if other students are planning to address this with the department."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I just saw someone cheat on the midterm right in front of me. It makes me sick that I'm studying so hard and they're just looking at notes on their phone.", "output": "It is really disheartening to see dishonesty when you are putting in so much honest effort. Your feeling of disgust is valid because it violates your sense of fairness. Focus on your own integrity and hard work; those are things no one can fake or take away from you."}

Enjoy spending it on something fun!"}

What am I going to do?", "output": "The uncertainty of life after graduation is terrifying, and so many students feel exactly the same way. It’s okay not to have everything figured out the second you get your diploma. You have time to find your path, and right now, just taking it one application at a time is enough."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I don't like how I look in the mirror today. I feel like I've gained weight and none of my clothes fit right. I just want to stay inside.", "output": "I hear you, and I'm sorry you're having a tough body image day; those feelings can be really heavy. You are so much more than how your clothes fit or a reflection in the mirror. Try to do something kind for your body today, like a warm stretch or drinking tea, simply because you deserve care."}

I'm going to get a bad grade because of them.", "output": "It is completely infuriating to feel like you're carrying the weight of a whole team. You shouldn't have to manage other people's responsibilities. Document what you've done, and remember that your effort counts, even if the situation is unfair."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I think I might have lost my wallet. I can't find it anywhere in my dorm. My ID and debit card are in there.", "output": "That is a really stressful situation that would make anyone panic. Try to retrace your steps calmly—check your pockets, bag, and recent locations. Even in the worst-case scenario, cards can be cancelled and IDs replaced, so you will get through this."}

I don't know how to function.", "output": "I am so deeply sorry for your loss. Please give yourself permission to grieve; you shouldn't have to force yourself to function as if everything is normal.

{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: A guy in my class keeps making really inappropriate jokes. It makes my skin crawl. I just try to look away.", "output": "Your reaction is completely valid; being around behavior that crosses boundaries is uncomfortable and draining.

It’s okay to mourn the way things used to be while also accepting that change is natural. Those memories are still yours to keep, even if the dynamic is shifting."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: My bank account is almost empty and rent is due next week. I'm scared I won't be able to pay it.", "output": "Financial stress is incredibly scary and overwhelming. It’s a heavy burden to carry alone. Is there a campus financial aid office or a local student support service you could talk to? Taking even one small step toward a solution might help lower the panic a little."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm thinking of changing my major. I'm not sure if I like Computer Science anymore. Maybe I'll switch to History.", "output": "That sounds like a big decision, but also an exciting opportunity to explore what you really love. College is the perfect time to figure these things out. Take your time weighing your options; there's no rush to have it all decided today."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My laptop crashed right before I saved my paper. I lost three pages of writing! I want to throw this computer out the window.", "output": "Oh no, that is absolutely devastating and rage-inducing! Losing work is one of the worst feelings. Scream into a pillow if you need to, then take a break before trying to tackle it again—sometimes the second draft flows faster than the first."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: My quiet roommate actually invited me to a concert tonight. I didn't think she liked music, let alone hanging out.", "output": "That’s a really cool and unexpected development! It’s always nice when people surprise us with new sides of themselves. I hope you have a great time if you decide to go!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I made a really good dinner tonight. Usually I just eat ramen, but I actually cooked vegetables and chicken. It tasted amazing.", "output": "That’s awesome! Cooking a nourishing meal for yourself is such a great form of self-care. I’m glad it tasted amazing—you should be proud of treating yourself to something good."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel like everyone is smarter than me here. I have to study twice as hard just to get average grades. I feel stupid.", "output": "Comparing yourself to others is a thief of joy, but I know how hard it is not to do it. You are not stupid; everyone learns at different paces and has different strengths. Your persistence and work ethic are valuable qualities that grades don't always capture."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I saw a post on social media mocking people with anxiety. It was so mean-spirited. I hate how cruel people can be online.", "output": "It is really disheartening and gross to see that kind of negativity, especially about something so many people struggle with. It’s good that you have the empathy to recognize how wrong it is. Sometimes the best thing to do is disconnect and curate your feed to include more kindness."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I studied so hard for that calculus exam, but I still failed. I feel like I'm just not smart enough for this major.", "output": "I hear how disappointed and discouraged you are feeling right now, and that makes total sense given how much effort you put in. Failing a test doesn't define your intelligence or your worth as a student. It's okay to take some time to just be sad about the result before you think about next steps. You are tackling a really difficult subject, and struggling with it is a common experience, not a sign of failure."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I walked into a public restroom and the smell was so bad I had to walk right back out.", "output": "That is a visceral, unpleasant experience. Our sense of smell is a powerful warning system, and retreating was the only logical move! It is really gross when public spaces aren't maintained. I hope you were able to find a cleaner facility elsewhere without too much trouble."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My roommate left their dirty dishes in the sink again for the third day in a row. It's so disrespectful!", "output": "That sounds incredibly frustrating and it is valid to feel disrespected in your own living space. Living with others is hard, especially when cleanliness standards don't match up. It makes sense that you are angry because it feels like your time and space aren't being valued. Maybe take a moment to cool down so you don't have to approach the conversation while you're at peak frustration."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: You won't believe it, but I finally got the internship I wanted! I've been smiling all day.", "output": "That is absolutely wonderful news! Congratulations on landing the internship; your hard work has clearly paid off. It is great to hear that you are allowing yourself to celebrate and enjoy this moment of success. Hold onto this feeling, you deserve to feel proud of this accomplishment!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I don't really have much going on this weekend. Just feeling kind of bored and aimless.", "output": "It sounds like things are pretty quiet for you right now, and sometimes that lack of structure can feel a bit weird. Boredom can actually be a good opportunity to recharge, even if it feels a little dull in the moment. You don't always have to be productive or busy to have a valid weekend. Maybe just resting is exactly what you need right now."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: Everyone else seems to be making friends so easily, but I still feel like an outsider. I just sit in my room mostly.", "output": "Loneliness is such a heavy feeling, and it is really hard when it seems like everyone else is connecting effortlessly. Please know that what you see on the outside doesn't always reflect how others are truly feeling; many people struggle with belonging. It takes time to find your people, and it is okay that it hasn't happened instantly. Being gentle with yourself during this transition is really important."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm making a grocery list for the week. Trying to be more organized with my meals.", "output": "Meal planning is such a great way to feel organized and save stress later in the week.

That must be such a relief to have that massive weight lifted off your shoulders so unexpectedly. It sounds like you just gained a whole week of your life back. I hope you can use some of that found time to relax or do something you actually enjoy!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I don't know what I'm going to do after graduation. The future feels like this big black hole and I'm scared I'll make the wrong choice.", "output": "The uncertainty of the future is incredibly daunting, and feeling scared about the 'unknown' is a very human reaction. You don't have to have the rest of your life mapped out right this second. It is okay to take small steps without knowing exactly where the path leads. Trust that you have the tools to navigate things as they come, rather than needing to predict everything now."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: My dog back home is sick and my parents didn't tell me until today because they didn't want to worry me. I feel guilty for not being there.", "output": "I am so sorry to hear about your dog; being away from home when a pet is sick is heartbreaking. It is natural to feel guilty, but please remind yourself that you didn't know and you aren't doing anything wrong by being at school. Your love for your dog is real regardless of the distance. Be kind to yourself today, this is a really tough emotional spot to be in."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: We have a group project due Friday and one guy hasn't answered a single text. I'm going to have to do all his work.", "output": "It is completely unfair that you are being put in a position to carry the workload for someone else. Your anger is justified because your time and grade are being jeopardized by someone else's lack of responsibility. It is exhausting to have to manage people when you are just trying to be a student. Make sure to document what is happening so you can protect your own grade."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: My best friend from high school is coming to visit this weekend! I haven't seen her in six months.", "output": "That is so exciting!

I'm kind of tired but I know I should work out.", "output": "That is the classic dilemma! It sounds like you are weighing the benefits of movement against the need for rest. Listen to your body; if you are genuinely exhausted, a nap might be more productive for your health than forcing a workout. Whatever you choose, try not to beat yourself up about it."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I saw my ex with someone new on social media today. I thought I was over it, but it really stung.", "output": "Seeing that can feel like a punch in the gut, even if you thought you had moved on. Healing isn't linear, and it is okay to feel a fresh wave of sadness triggered by seeing them with someone else. Give yourself permission to feel that hurt without judging yourself for 'not being over it' yet. You are doing the best you can."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I checked my bank account and I have way less money than I thought. I'm worried about paying for groceries this month.", "output": "Financial stress is incredibly heavy and scary, and seeing a low balance can make your stomach drop. It makes sense that you are feeling anxious about meeting your basic needs. Take a deep breath; right now, panic is the enemy. Maybe once the initial shock wears off, you can look at local resources or campus food pantries that are there to help students in exactly this situation."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: The person sitting next to me in lecture kept coughing without covering their mouth. It was so gross.", "output": "That is really unpleasant and honestly pretty inconsiderate of them. It is natural to feel disgusted when someone isn't practicing basic hygiene in a shared space. Being trapped in a seat next to that makes it even worse. I hope you manage to stay healthy despite the exposure!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I actually enjoyed my history class today. I usually hate it, but the lecture was fascinating.", "output": "That is a pleasant surprise! It is always nice when something mundane turns out to be engaging. Maybe this specific topic just clicked with you in a way others haven't. It’s cool that you were open enough to enjoy it even though you usually dislike the class."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I fixed my leaking faucet all by myself! I felt so handy and capable.", "output": "That is a major feeling of accomplishment! household repairs can be intimidating, so figuring it out yourself is a huge win. You saved money and learned a new skill\u9225\u6516hat is definitely something to be proud of. Now every time you use the sink, you can admire your handiwork!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My parents are constantly nagging me about my grades. I'm doing my best, but it's never enough for them.", "output": "It sounds exhausting to feel like you are constantly under a microscope despite your best efforts. It hurts when the people who should support you only seem to criticize or demand more. Your best *is* enough, regardless of what they say. Try to validate your own efforts so their pressure doesn't crush your self-esteem."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have to go to this networking event tonight and I'm awful at small talk. I'm afraid I'll say something stupid.", "output": "Social anxiety before a networking event is very common; the pressure to impress people is high. Remember that most people there are probably feeling a bit awkward too, even if they hide it well. You don't have to be the most charismatic person in the room, just being polite and listening is often enough. You can get through this one conversation at a time."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I finally finished that 20-page paper. I feel like I can breathe again!", "output": "What a massive relief!

It's tedious, but it needs to be done.", "output": "It sounds like you are in a very practical, 'get-it-done' mindset right now. While it isn't the most exciting way to spend time, that preparation will probably make your life much easier next week. Kudos to you for having the discipline to get through the boring stuff."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: It's been raining for a week straight and the gray skies are really bringing my mood down.", "output": "The weather has a huge impact on how we feel, and a week of gray skies can definitely make everything feel heavier. It is valid to feel low energy or sad when the sun hasn't come out in a while. Maybe try to do something cozy inside that brings you a little bit of warmth or light today."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I walked into the bathroom and there was mold growing on the ceiling. I can't believe I pay rent for this.", "output": "That is absolutely vile and a health hazard. You have every right to be disgusted and angry about the state of your living conditions. It feels incredibly unfair to pay for a space that isn't being maintained properly. Definitely report that to your landlord or maintenance immediately."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: My quiet roommate actually invited me to grab coffee today. I never thought they wanted to hang out.", "output": "Oh, that is a nice turn of events! It is always surprising when someone breaks their usual pattern to reach out. It sounds like a cool opportunity to get to know them better if you are up for it. Sometimes people are just shy and it takes them a while to feel comfortable enough to ask."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I think I might have chosen the wrong major. I'm three years in and suddenly I don't like any of my classes.", "output": "That is a really scary realization to have, especially when you feel like you have already invested so much time. Please know that this panic is something many students face, and your degree doesn't lock you into one specific career path forever. It is okay to feel lost right now. You have time to pivot or explore other interests without throwing everything away."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: The wifi cut out right in the middle of my online quiz and the professor won't let me retake it!", "output": "That is infuriating! It is a technical issue completely out of your control, and being penalized for it feels incredibly unjust. It makes total sense that you are angry at the inflexibility of the situation. I hope you can escalate this to a department head or someone who might be more reasonable."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I cooked a meal from scratch today and it actually tasted good. I usually burn everything.", "output": "That is a great little victory! Cooking is a skill, and it feels so good when you finally nail a recipe. It sounds like you should be proud of your culinary progress. Enjoy your meal, it tastes even better when you made it yourself!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I missed my little sister's birthday because I couldn't afford the flight home. She was crying on the phone.", "output": "That is heartbreaking, and I can feel how much you love your sister and want to be there for her. Financial constraints are so hard when they separate us from family. Please try not to internalize her sadness as your failure; you are doing the best you can. You can still celebrate with her in other special ways from afar."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm just waiting for the bus. It's running a few minutes late.", "output": "Waiting around is never fun, but it sounds like you are taking it in stride. Hopefully, it shows up soon so you can get where you are going. Hang in there, just a few more minutes of patience!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel like I'm failing at everything right now. I studied so hard for my bio exam and still barely passed.", "output": "I'm so sorry you're going through this. It is incredibly frustrating to put in that much effort and not see the result you wanted. Please be gentle with yourself; one grade doesn't define your intelligence or your worth."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel like time is moving too fast. Another year is almost over and I haven't done half the things I wanted to.", "output": "That sense of time slipping away can be really melancholy and anxiety-inducing. It is easy to look at a list of uncompleted goals and feel like you failed, but you have likely lived and grown in ways you didn't plan for. It is okay to mourn the time that has passed, but try to be gentle with yourself. You are living your life, not just checking off boxes."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My neighbor is blasting music at 2 AM on a Tuesday! Some of us have to work!", "output": "That is incredibly selfish and rude of them. Sleep is essential, and having it stolen by someone else's noise is maddening. You have every right to be furious. It is so disrespectful to the community. I hope they turn it down soon so you can get the rest you desperately need."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm just really tired today. Didn't sleep well and classes dragged on forever.", "output": "I hear you; some days just feel longer and heavier than others. It sounds like you need a bit of rest and recharge time tonight. Hopefully, you can take it easy this evening and get a better night's sleep."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I actually got the internship I applied for! I didn't think I had a chance.", "output": "That is absolutely amazing news! A huge congratulations to you. It is wonderful to see your hard work and potential being recognized like this."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I walked into the communal kitchen and it smelled awful. Nobody ever cleans up their mess.", "output": "Ugh, that sounds really unpleasant. Living in shared spaces can be so difficult when others don't pull their weight. It is totally valid to feel frustrated by the lack of cleanliness and consideration."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: My friends all went out without me last night. I saw the photos on Instagram and it just hurts.", "output": "I can imagine how much that stings. Feeling left out is such a lonely and painful experience. It's okay to feel sad about it; maybe treating yourself to something nice today could help lift your spirits a little."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I'm worried I chose the wrong major. Everyone else seems to get it, but I'm struggling to keep up.", "output": "That is a very heavy worry to carry, but you are definitely not alone in feeling it. Many students question their path at some point. It might help to talk to an advisor, but for now, just know that struggling doesn't mean you don't belong."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprise\nUser: My parents just showed up at my dorm unannounced. I haven't cleaned in weeks!", "output": "Oh wow, that is definitely a shock! It is stressful to be caught off guard like that, especially when you aren't prepared for guests. Try not to worry too much about the mess; hopefully, they are just happy to see you."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I think I left the stove on. I'm halfway to work and I can't remember turning it off.", "output": "That sudden panic is the worst feeling! It creates such a loop of anxiety in your mind. Is there a roommate, neighbor, or landlord you could call to check for you? If not, for your own peace of mind, it might be worth turning back if you can. It is likely off and your brain is just playing tricks, but safety comes first."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: The professor changed the deadline to tomorrow morning at the last minute. It's completely unfair!", "output": "That sounds incredibly stressful and frustrating. Having the rug pulled out from under you like that is not cool. It makes total sense that you are angry about the sudden pressure."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I don't know if I'll be able to afford rent next semester. My hours at work got cut.", "output": "Financial stress is incredibly draining and scary. It is a really difficult position to be in. Are there any student resources or financial aid offices on campus you could reach out to for advice? You shouldn't have to carry this worry alone."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: My long-distance boyfriend surprised me with a visit this weekend!", "output": "That is such a sweet surprise! It must be so wonderful to see him after being apart. I hope you two have a fantastic weekend making memories together."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: Just finished my last exam. I don't even know how to feel yet, just numb.", "output": "That 'post-exam numbness' is a very real thing. You've been running on adrenaline for so long, it takes time for your brain to realize it can stop. Take your time easing back into relaxation."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel like I'm drifting apart from my high school best friend. We barely have anything to say to each other anymore.", "output": "Growing pains in friendships are heartbreaking. It is sad to feel that distance growing with someone who used to be so close. Just remember that relationships ebb and flow, and cherishing the past doesn't mean the friendship has failed."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: A guy in my class made a really inappropriate joke today. It made me feel so gross.", "output": "I am so sorry you had to hear that. It is really unsettling when people say things that are disrespectful or offensive. Your reaction is completely valid; you shouldn't have to deal with that kind of behavior."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow to check out a lump and I'm panicking.", "output": "Health scares are terrifying, and the waiting is often the hardest part. It is okay to be scared right now. Try to be kind to yourself tonight and distract yourself with something comforting if you can."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My group project partners are useless. I'm doing all the work and they're going to get the same grade.", "output": "That is a classic source of frustration for students, and it is genuinely unfair. You have every right to be annoyed that your hard work is carrying the team. Is it possible to speak to the instructor about the imbalance?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I finally cleaned my entire apartment. It feels so good to sit in a clean room.", "output": "That is a great accomplishment! A clean space can really help clear your mind and make you feel more at peace. Enjoy that fresh, organized feeling—you earned it."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I just feel really lonely. I see people in groups on campus and I feel like an outsider.", "output": "Loneliness is such a heavy feeling, especially when surrounded by others. It takes a lot of courage to admit that. Please know that many of those people in groups likely feel similar insecurities, even if it doesn't look like it."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I sent a text to my crush telling them I like them and they haven't replied in three hours.", "output": "The waiting game is absolute torture. It is natural for your mind to race with worst-case scenarios right now. Try to put your phone in another room for a bit; three hours feels like forever, but they might just be busy."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm thinking about changing my hair color. Maybe blue or green.", "output": "That sounds like a fun change! Experimenting with your look can be a great way to express yourself. Do you have a specific shade in mind that you think would suit you?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: The food in the cafeteria was undercooked today. I almost threw up.", "output": "That sounds absolutely revolting. Food safety is no joke, and it is startling to bite into something raw like that. I hope you were able to find something else safe to eat."}

It is heartbreaking to feel like you don't measure up. Please remember you were accepted into this program for a reason, just like everyone else."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I ran into my elementary school teacher at the grocery store. She looks exactly the same!", "output": "That is such a surreal experience! It feels like a glitch in the timeline to see a figure from your childhood out in the real world, unchanged. It must have brought back a flood of memories. It is nice to know that some things\u9225\u6501nd people\u9225\u6515tay consistent."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: I got a parking ticket even though I was only there for two minutes dropping off a book!", "output": "That is incredibly frustrating! It feels so unjust to be penalized for such a quick stop. It is totally normal to be fuming about that right now."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprise\nUser: I just realized I've been calling my professor by the wrong name for the entire semester.", "output": "Oh no! That is definitely an awkward realization. If it makes you feel better, professors see hundreds of students and likely understand that mistakes happen. Try to laugh it off if you can!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: It's my birthday and nobody remembered.", "output": "I am so, so sorry. That is incredibly hurtful and it is okay to cry about it. You deserve to be celebrated. Happy Birthday from me—I know it's not the same, but you matter."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I finished my thesis! I can't believe it's finally done.", "output": "That is a monumental achievement! You should be incredibly proud of yourself for sticking with it and finishing. Take a deep breath and celebrate this huge milestone."}

Everyone else seems to handle it just fine, but I'm barely sleeping and still falling behind.", "output": "I hear how overwhelmed you are right now. It’s really tough when it feels like everyone else is swimming while you're struggling to stay afloat, but please remember that appearances can be deceiving. Your exhaustion is valid, and it's okay to take a step back to breathe."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have to give a presentation in my seminar tomorrow and I'm terrified. My hands shake whenever I have to speak in front of people.", "output": "That sounds really nerve-wracking. Public speaking anxiety is so common, and it makes total sense that you're feeling this way given the pressure. Maybe try to focus on just getting through the first minute; you've got this, even if it feels scary right now."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My roommate ate the food I specifically meal-prepped for the week. I labeled it and everything! I'm so mad I can't even talk to them.", "output": "That is incredibly frustrating! It shows a real lack of respect for your boundaries and your hard work. It makes total sense that you need some space before addressing it with them."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I finally got an A on my chemistry mid-term! I studied for two weeks straight and I was so sure I failed.", "output": "That is amazing news! It sounds like all that hard work and dedication really paid off. You should be really proud of yourself for turning that anxiety into such a great result!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: The communal kitchen in my dorm is absolutely filthy. There's moldy food in the sink and it smells terrible. I don't even want to cook there.", "output": "Ugh, that sounds absolutely nasty. It's really unfair that you have to deal with such an unhygienic environment just to make dinner. I completely understand why you'd want to stay away from there."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm just spending the day doing laundry and catching up on reading. Nothing special going on.", "output": "Sometimes those quiet, productive days are exactly what we need to reset. It sounds like a nice, low-stress way to get ready for the week ahead. Enjoy the downtime!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I saw someone clip their toenails on the train today. I can't believe people do that in public.", "output": "That is absolutely vile! Public grooming of that nature is a huge social taboo for a reason. It is incredibly disrespectful to everyone else in that shared space. I don't blame you for being disgusted; that is an image (and sound) you probably want to scrub from your brain immediately."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I don't know what I'm doing with my life. I'm a junior and I still don't have an internship lined up. I'm scared I'm going to graduate and be unemployed.", "output": "That uncertainty about the future is such a heavy burden to carry. It makes sense that you're feeling anxious when there's so much pressure to have everything figured out. Remember that everyone's timeline is different, and you still have time to find your path."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My professor changed the due date to tomorrow without sending an email. I only found out because a friend mentioned it. It's so unfair!", "output": "That sounds incredibly unfair and disorganized.

{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: My friends went out to the movies without me. I saw it on their Instagram stories. I thought we were close.", "output": "That is such a painful thing to discover. Feeling excluded hurts deeply, especially when it involves people you trust and care about. It makes sense that you're questioning things right now."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I think I lost my wallet. It has my ID and my credit card in it. I've retraced my steps three times and I can't find it anywhere.", "output": "Oh no, that is a really scary situation. The panic of losing sensitive items is overwhelming. Take a deep breath; hopefully, someone has turned it into the lost and found."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: My crush actually texted me back! We've been talking for like an hour about music.", "output": "That’s so exciting! It’s a great feeling when the conversation just flows naturally with someone you like. Enjoy those butterflies!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I think I'm going to go for a run later. It's been a while since I exercised.", "output": "That sounds like a solid plan. Getting some fresh air and movement can be really refreshing, especially after a break. Hope you have a good run!"}

It’s devastating when you put your heart into something and don't get the result you wanted. It’s okay to grieve this opportunity; your effort still counts for a lot."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My parents keep tracking my location on my phone. I'm 20 years old! I feel like I have zero privacy.", "output": "It’s completely understandable that you feel suffocated by that. At your age, having autonomy and privacy is important, and it feels disrespectful when that isn't acknowledged. That sounds really frustrating to deal with."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: My car started making a really loud clunking noise. I have no money to fix it if it breaks down.", "output": "That is a really stressful situation to be in. The financial anxiety of unexpected car trouble is huge, especially as a student. Hopefully, it’s something minor, but your worry is totally justified."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I opened my yogurt and it was completely green and fuzzy on top. I almost threw up.", "output": "Ew, that is disgusting! There's nothing worse than expecting a snack and finding... that. I don't blame you for feeling nauseous after seeing it."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I got a scholarship check in the mail today that I didn't even apply for. I think the department nominated me?", "output": "That is an incredible surprise! It must feel amazing to be recognized for your hard work without even expecting it. What a wonderful boost to your day!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I finally finished painting my room. It looks so much better and brighter now.", "output": "That’s awesome! Creating a space that feels good to be in makes such a difference for your mood. It sounds like your hard work really transformed the room."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm just waiting for my laundry to dry. Sitting in the laundromat watching the clothes spin.", "output": "There is something weirdly hypnotic and meditative about watching laundry spin. It is a forced pause in your day where you can't really do much else but wait. I hope you have a book or some music to pass the time comfortably while the machines do the work."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I need to buy groceries today. I'm completely out of milk and bread.", "output": "Sounds like it's time for a re-stock run. It’s always a bit of a chore, but it feels good to have the fridge full again. Safe travels to the store!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: There's a weird storm warning for tonight. I hate thunder, it makes me feel like a little kid again.", "output": "Storms can be really unsettling, no matter how old you are. It’s okay to feel anxious about the noise and the weather. Maybe you can put on some headphones or find a cozy spot to distract yourself until it passes."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: I've been waiting for the bus for 45 minutes in the rain. The app says it's here but it's ghosting me.", "output": "That is beyond frustrating. Being stranded in the rain when you're relying on public transit is the worst. You have every right to be annoyed at the unreliability."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: My lab partner keeps picking his nose when he thinks no one is looking. I have to touch the equipment after him.", "output": "Oh, that is seriously gross. Hygiene is so important, especially in a shared lab space. I completely get why you'd be repulsed by that."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: I stepped in gum on the sidewalk. These are my new shoes!", "output": "Oh no, that is infuriating! It is such a sticky, messy nuisance that is completely avoidable if people just used trash cans. Ruining new shoes makes it sting so much more. I hope you can get it off with some ice or peanut butter later, but you are totally right to be mad about the carelessness."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I woke up and realized it's Saturday. I thought it was Friday and I was about to rush to class.", "output": "That is the best kind of confusion! realizing you have a whole weekend ahead of you instead of a class is such a relief. Enjoy the unexpected free time!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel like I'm not learning anything. I go to lectures but nothing sticks. I feel like I'm wasting my tuition.", "output": "It sounds like you're feeling really discouraged about your academic progress. That imposter syndrome and the fear of wasting time are really tough to deal with. Be gentle with yourself; learning happens at different paces."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have to get a cavity filled today. I hate the dentist, the sound of the drill makes me panic.", "output": "Dental anxiety is very real and very common. It makes total sense that you're dreading the sensory experience of it. Just remember it will be over soon, and you're taking good care of your health by going."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel like I'm drifting away from my friends. We used to hang out every weekend, but now they all have new groups and inside jokes I don't get. It just hurts to be on the outside looking in.", "output": "It sounds incredibly painful to feel that distance growing between you and the people you care about. Feeling left out, especially when you used to be so close, is a very lonely experience. It makes sense that you’re feeling sad and isolated right now. Friendships do shift, but that doesn't make the transition any less heartbreaking. Have you felt able to reach out to any of them individually to share how you've been feeling?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have a huge presentation tomorrow for my final grade, and I'm terrified I'm going to freeze up. My hands are shaking just thinking about it. I don't think I can do this.", "output": "I can hear how much anxiety this presentation is causing you, and it’s completely understandable given how much is riding on it. That physical reaction—the shaking and the fear of freezing—is your body's way of saying this matters to you. It’s okay to be scared; it doesn't mean you aren't prepared. Try to take things one moment at a time rather than looking at the whole event. You've worked hard to get here, and it’s okay to just do your best, even if your voice shakes a little."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My roommate ate my leftovers again! I specifically wrote my name on the box. I am so sick of being disrespected in my own space.", "output": "That sounds incredibly frustrating! It’s not just about the food; it’s about the lack of respect for your boundaries and your personal property. You have every right to be angry when someone ignores a clear limit you've set. Your home should be a place where you feel your things are safe. It might be worth having a calm but firm conversation about boundaries when you're ready, but for now, it's totally valid to just be mad about it."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I finally got the internship I applied for! I’ve been rejected so many times, I didn’t think it would happen. I’m literally jumping up and down right now.", "output": "That is absolutely amazing news! Congratulations on landing the internship! It’s so rewarding when persistence finally pays off, especially after facing those previous rejections. Jumping up and down is the perfect reaction to such a big win. You should be really proud of yourself for keeping at it. I hope you take some time to celebrate this achievement today!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I just found out my ex has been spreading rumors about me to our mutual friends. It makes me feel sick to my stomach that I ever trusted them.", "output": "It is completely valid to feel disgusted and betrayed by that kind of behavior. Finding out that someone you once trusted is trying to damage your reputation is deeply hurtful. That physical sensation of feeling sick is a very natural response to such a violation of trust. You didn't deserve that, and it reflects poorly on them, not you. Surround yourself with people who know the real you and treat you with the respect you deserve."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I got asked to be a bridesmaid for my best friend's wedding! I'm so excited to help her plan.", "output": "That is such an honor! It shows how much she values your friendship and wants you by her side for her big moment. It sounds like you are going to be an amazing support for her. Have the best time planning and celebrating this special chapter together!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I just ran into my old high school teacher at the grocery store. I haven't seen him in three years, and he actually remembered my name!", "output": "That must have been such a pleasant shock! It’s really heartwarming when people from our past remember us, especially when we don't expect it. It shows that you made a lasting impression on him. Moments like that can really brighten up a regular day. It’s nice to be reminded of those connections from different chapters of our lives."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I failed my driving test for the second time. Everyone else got theirs on the first try. I feel like such a failure.", "output": "I'm so sorry to hear that you didn't pass this time; that disappointment stings really hard. It’s easy to compare yourself to others, but everyone learns skills at their own pace, and a test result doesn't define your worth. You are not a failure; you are just in the middle of learning something difficult. Give yourself some space to feel upset, but try to remember that many capable drivers took a few tries to get there. You will get this eventually."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: My parents are fighting a lot lately, and they stopped talking to each other. I'm scared they might get a divorce. I don't know what will happen to our family.", "output": "That is a really heavy burden to carry, and it makes total sense that you’re feeling scared about the uncertainty. The atmosphere at home affects you deeply, and the silence can sometimes be scarier than the shouting. It’s hard not knowing what the future holds for your family unit. Please remember that their relationship issues are not your fault and not your responsibility to fix. Be gentle with yourself while you navigate this stressful time."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: My best friend surprised me with tickets to a concert for my birthday! I had no idea she was planning this.", "output": "What a wonderful surprise! It sounds like you have a really thoughtful best friend who knows exactly how to make you feel special. That excitement of an unexpected gift is such a great feeling. It’s lovely to feel seen and celebrated by the people we love. I hope you both have an incredible time at the concert!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I look in the mirror and I just hate what I see. I feel like I'm never going to be attractive enough or thin enough. It's exhausting trying to keep up.", "output": "It sounds heartbreaking to feel that way about yourself and to be in a constant battle with your reflection. That pressure to look a certain way is incredibly draining and unfair. Your worth is not tied to your appearance, though I know it often feels that way in our society. You deserve to feel at home in your own body, not at war with it. Please be kind to yourself today; you are enough just as you are."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My professor gave me a C on a paper I worked on for weeks, with barely any feedback. It feels so arbitrary and unfair.", "output": "That is incredibly frustrating, especially when you poured so much time and effort into your work. To receive a grade that doesn't reflect your effort, without clear feedback, feels very unjust. You have every right to be annoyed by the lack of communication. It might be helpful to visit their office hours to ask for clarification, but for now, it’s okay to just be mad about the situation. Your hard work still has value, even if this grade didn't show it."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I'm graduating in two months and I have no job lined up. I feel like I'm going to end up unemployed and living in my parents' basement forever.", "output": "The transition from school to the workforce is one of the most anxiety-inducing times in life. It is completely normal to fear the unknown and imagine worst-case scenarios. Many people don't have jobs lined up immediately upon graduation, and it doesn't mean you're doomed to fail. You are taking a big step, and it's okay to feel shaky about it. Take it one application at a time, and try to trust that you will find your path."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: The cafeteria food today was absolutely revolt. I think I saw something moving in the salad. I can't believe we pay for this.", "output": "That sounds absolutely awful! Finding something like that in your food is a genuine shock and completely gross. You have every right to be disgusted; food safety is a basic expectation, especially when you're paying for a meal plan. It’s really disappointing when basic needs aren't met with care. I hope you were able to find something else safe to eat afterwards."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: Just finished watching a whole season of a show. Now I don't know what to do with myself. Just sitting here.", "output": "That post-series feeling can be surprisingly empty, like a little bubble just popped. It sounds like you're in a bit of a lull now that the distraction is over. It’s okay to just sit and be idle for a bit; we don't always have to be productive. Maybe this is a good moment to stretch your legs or grab a snack. Or just enjoying the quiet is perfectly fine too."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I missed my little sister's school play because I had to work. She was crying when I called her. I feel like the worst brother ever.", "output": "The guilt you are feeling sounds really heavy, and it’s clear how much you love your sister. Missing important moments because of responsibilities like work is a painful reality of adulthood, but it doesn't make you a bad brother. The fact that you care so much shows how good of a brother you actually are. Maybe you can plan a special time just for the two of you to make it up to her? You're doing your best."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I tried a new recipe for dinner and it actually didn't burn! It tasted pretty good. I'm usually a disaster in the kitchen.", "output": "That’s a fantastic surprise! It feels great when we step out of our comfort zone and succeed, especially when we expect the worst. Discovering that you can cook something tasty is a great confidence booster. You might have more culinary skills than you give yourself credit for. Enjoy your delicious meal—you earned it!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have to tell my parents I want to change my major from Pre-Med to Art History. They are going to flip out. I'm so scared of disappointing them.", "output": "That is a very brave but terrifying position to be in. The fear of disappointing your parents is profound, especially when it involves their expectations for your future. However, living a life that is true to your interests is so important for your long-term happiness. It’s okay to be scared of the confrontation. Regardless of their initial reaction, your passion and your choice for your own life are valid."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: My dog finally learned to shake hands! We've been practicing for weeks. He looked so proud of himself.", "output": "That is so cute! It’s really satisfying to see patience pay off when training a pet. The image of him looking proud is adorable. It sounds like a great bonding moment for both of you. Give him an extra treat from me for being such a good boy!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My group project partners haven't done a single thing. The deadline is in two days and I'm doing all the work. I want to scream.", "output": "I don't blame you for wanting to scream; that is unfair and incredibly stressful. Being forced to carry the load for others who aren't pulling their weight makes you feel taken advantage of. It is maddening to have your grade depend on unreliable people. You are showing a lot of resilience by getting the work done, but your anger is completely justified. Make sure you document what you've done in case you need to speak to the professor."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: My dog is getting really old and having trouble walking. I know the end is coming and I'm not ready.", "output": "I am so deeply sorry. Watching a beloved pet decline is a slow and heartbreaking kind of grief. It is the price we pay for their unconditional love, but it doesn't make it any easier. Just love him as much as you can right now and keep him comfortable. You are doing a wonderful job being there for him, even when it hurts."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I saw someone being really rude to the janitor today, just mocking them. It made me so angry and grossed out that people can be that mean.", "output": "It is deeply upsetting to witness cruelty like that. Feeling disgust at someone's lack of empathy shows that you have a kind heart and value respect for everyone. It’s repulsive when people punch down or treat others poorly based on their job. Hold onto that feeling—it’s your moral compass telling you what’s right. The world needs more people who care about how others are treated."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have to walk past a construction site where the workers catcall women. I dread it every day.", "output": "That is an awful and threatening situation to be in. You should not have to feel unsafe or objectified just walking down the street. It is completely valid to feel fear and dread. Is there any alternative route you can take, even if it's longer? Your safety and peace of mind are the most important things."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm just organizing my notes for the week. Color coding everything. It's kind of boring but necessary.", "output": "It sounds like you are in a very productive, organized mode right now. While it might feel boring, there is something satisfying about getting everything in order and ready for the week. Color coding can be quite soothing in a repetitive way. You are setting your future self up for success, which is a great thing to do. Keep up the good work."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I just had the best first date! We talked for four hours and didn't even look at our phones. I think I really like them.", "output": "That sounds absolutely magical! Finding that kind of easy, flowing connection where time just disappears is rare and special. It’s so exciting to feel that spark and the potential for something new. Enjoy those butterflies and this happy feeling. I hope this is the start of something lovely for you!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: My childhood dog passed away this morning. I'm at college so I couldn't even say goodbye. I feel empty.", "output": "I am so incredibly sorry for your loss. Losing a childhood pet is losing a family member and a witness to your growing up. Being away at college and not being able to say goodbye adds a whole other layer of pain and guilt to the grief. Please know that your dog knew how much you loved them, regardless of where you were today. Allow yourself to cry and feel that emptiness; it’s a measure of how much love was there."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My internet cut out right in the middle of an online exam! The professor says I can't retake it. This is going to tank my GPA.", "output": "That is a nightmare scenario and completely unfair! To be penalized for a technical issue beyond your control is infuriating. You have every right to be outraged; your grade should reflect your knowledge, not your internet connection. It feels like the system is failing you. I hope there is a department head or dean you can appeal to, because that is a valid reason to be upset. Don't give up fighting for a fair chance."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I applied for a scholarship I was sure I wouldn't get, and I just got the email that I won! I can't believe it!", "output": "That is phenomenal news! What a fantastic surprise to have your self-doubt proven wrong in the best way possible. It just goes to show that you are more qualified and capable than you think you are. This scholarship is a huge validation of your hard work. Enjoy the shock and the celebration—you truly deserve this win!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have to walk home alone tonight and it's late. The streetlights are out on my block. I'm really nervous.", "output": "Your safety is the most important thing, so it makes total sense that you are feeling nervous. Walking alone in the dark is an instinctually scary situation. Please stay on the phone with someone if you can, or keep your keys ready in your hand. Trust your gut—if something feels off, go to a public place or call a ride if possible. I'm hoping you get home safely and quickly."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I ordered a dress online and it actually fits perfectly! Usually, they are always too small or too big.", "output": "That is the holy grail of online shopping! It is always such a gamble, so winning and getting the perfect fit feels like a real victory. It saves you the hassle of returns and disappointment. You must be so excited to wear it out!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I failed my math midterm today. I studied so hard for it, but my mind just went blank during the test. I feel like such a failure.", "output": "I'm so sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It is incredibly frustrating when you put in the effort and the results don't match up, but one test does not define your worth or your intelligence. Be gentle with yourself tonight; you did your best, and that matters."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have to give a presentation in front of the whole class tomorrow. I'm terrified I'm going to mess up or forget my lines.", "output": "It is completely normal to feel nervous about public speaking; almost everyone does! Try to take some deep breaths and remember that your classmates are likely focusing on their own presentations, not judging yours. You have prepared for this, and you can get through it one step at a time."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My roommate ate my leftovers again without asking. I'm so sick of them disrespecting my stuff!", "output": "That sounds really frustrating. It is important to feel like your personal space and belongings are respected in your own home. Maybe when you are feeling calmer, you can have a clear conversation with them about setting better boundaries."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: My coworker microwaves fish in the breakroom every day. The whole office smells terrible.", "output": "That is a classic office crime! It is so inconsiderate to subject everyone to such a strong, lingering smell in a shared space. It makes it hard to enjoy your own lunch or focus on work. You are definitely not alone in finding that gross and annoying."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I finally got the internship I applied for! I can't believe they actually picked me.", "output": "That is absolutely wonderful news! Congratulations on your success; it sounds like your hard work really paid off. You should be very proud of yourself for achieving this goal."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm sorting through my old emails. Deleting spam and organizing folders.", "output": "Digital decluttering can be surprisingly tedious but rewarding. Getting that inbox number down feels like lightening a mental load. It is a good, low-energy task to get done. I hope you get through the backlog quickly."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: The wifi has been down for three hours! I can't get any work done and the ISP won't give me an update.", "output": "That is incredibly frustrating. We rely so heavily on the internet that losing it feels like being cut off from the world. The lack of communication from the provider just adds to the helpless feeling. It is a total waste of your productive time. Hopefully, it comes back on soon so you can salvage the day."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm just really tired. I've been pulling all-nighters to finish my final project.", "output": "It sounds like you are exhausted and running on fumes. While finishing your project is important, please try to listen to your body and sneak in some rest where you can. You can't pour from an empty cup, so taking a small break might actually help you focus better."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I went for a run this morning and beat my personal best time! I feel so strong.", "output": "Way to go! Smashing a personal goal is such a rush of endorphins and pride. It is proof that your hard work and consistency are paying off. Enjoy that feeling of strength and accomplishment\u9225\u651cou earned every second of it!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I just bumped into my ex on campus. I wasn't expecting to see them, and it completely threw me off.", "output": "That must have been a real shock to your system. Unexpected encounters like that can bring up a rush of old emotions all at once. Take a moment to ground yourself and breathe; it is okay to feel shaken up by the surprise."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: The professor changed the assignment requirements two days before the deadline! It's so unfair.", "output": "That sounds incredibly stressful and unfair. It is completely valid to feel angry when the goalposts are moved at the last minute. Just do the best you can with the time you have remaining; that is all anyone can ask of you."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I'm worried I chose the wrong major. What if I graduate and realize I hate this field?", "output": "Questioning your path is a very common part of the college experience. It is okay not to have your entire future mapped out perfectly right now. Remember that many skills are transferable, and your degree is just one step in a long journey of discovering what you love."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I just don't like how I look in the mirror. I feel like I'm not as pretty as the other girls in my dorm.", "output": "It breaks my heart to hear you talk about yourself that way. It is so easy to compare ourselves to others, but your worth is not defined by your appearance. You are unique and valuable just as you are, and you deserve to be kind to yourself."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: The cafeteria food was absolutely gross today. I think the chicken was undercooked. I lost my appetite.", "output": "That sounds really unpleasant and definitely unappetizing. Food safety is important, so it is natural to feel repulsed by something that looks unsafe to eat. Hopefully, you can find something else to snack on later so you don't go hungry."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: My long-distance boyfriend surprised me with a visit for the weekend! I'm so excited!", "output": "That is such a sweet surprise!

{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I have a lot of chores to do this weekend. Just laundry and cleaning mostly.", "output": "It sounds like a productive, albeit mundane, weekend ahead.

{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I wasn't invited to the party everyone is talking about. I thought I was close with them.", "output": "Feeling left out is one of the most painful feelings, especially when it involves people you care about. It is okay to feel hurt and confused by their actions. Try to do something kind for yourself tonight, even if it's just watching your favorite movie."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow to check out a lump I found. I'm really scared it might be something bad.", "output": "That is a very frightening situation to be in, and your anxiety is completely understandable. Waiting for answers is often the hardest part. I'm sending you good thoughts, and I hope you have someone close by who can support you while you wait for the appointment."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: I can't believe I got a parking ticket! I was only five minutes late getting back to my car.", "output": "That is so frustrating! It feels terrible to be penalized for such a small mistake. Allow yourself to vent about it for a moment, and then try not to let it ruin the rest of your day."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I finally finished writing my thesis. It took months, but I just hit submit!", "output": "Congratulations! That is a massive accomplishment and a huge weight off your shoulders. You should definitely celebrate this milestone; you worked incredibly hard to get here."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I'm feeling really homesick today. I miss my mom's cooking and just being in my own bed.", "output": "Homesickness is a heavy ache. It is okay to really miss the comfort and familiarity of home, especially the sensory things like food and your own space. It doesn't mean you aren't handling things well where you are; it just means you have strong roots. Be gentle with yourself today."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have a weird rash on my arm and I made the mistake of Googling it. Now I'm convinced I'm dying.", "output": "Dr. Google is the worst for anxiety! It always shows the worst-case scenarios. It is really easy to spiral into panic when it comes to health stuff. Try to close the tabs and distract yourself until you can see a real doctor. It is mostly likely something simple and treatable, not the scary things you read online."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I tried to bake bread for the first time and it actually rose! It looks like a real loaf.", "output": "That is magical! Yeast can be so finicky, so getting a good rise on your first try is impressive. The smell of fresh bread baking is one of the best surprises. I bet it is going to taste even better than it looks.

{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: My professor complimented my insights during the seminar today. It made me feel really smart.", "output": "That is fantastic! recognition from a mentor can be such a great confidence boost. You deserve to feel proud of your intelligence and your contribution to the class."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My group partner didn't do their part of the project, and now we both might get a lower grade.", "output": "That is incredibly unfair and frustrating. You shouldn't have to carry the weight of someone else's lack of effort. If you can, it might be worth speaking to your instructor about the situation so your hard work is recognized."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I'm graduating next month and I still don't have a job lined up. Everyone else seems to have offers.", "output": "The transition out of school is a time full of uncertainty, and it is normal to feel anxious about it. Everyone moves at their own pace, even if it looks like others are ahead. Trust that the right opportunity will come along for you in due time."}

I haven't seen them in months because tickets are too expensive.", "output": "Being away from family for a long time is really hard on the heart.

{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I really messed up my math midterm. I studied so hard for it, but my mind just went blank when I saw the questions. Now I feel like I'm going to fail the whole class.", "output": "I'm so sorry to hear that the exam didn't go as planned, especially after you put in so much effort. It is incredibly frustrating when our brains don't cooperate in high-pressure moments. Remember that one test doesn't define your intelligence or your entire grade. Be gentle with yourself tonight."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have to give a presentation in my history class tomorrow and I am terrified. I hate public speaking and I'm scared I'll stutter or forget my lines in front of everyone.", "output": "It is completely normal to feel nervous before a presentation; almost everyone gets those butterflies! Your fear shows that you care about doing a good job. Try to take some deep breaths and remember that your classmates are likely more focused on their own presentations than judging yours. You've got this."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I put my hand under the table at a restaurant and touched old chewing gum. I need sanitizer ASAP.", "output": "Eww! That makes my skin crawl just hearing about it. It is such a violation of your personal space and hygiene. The panic to get clean immediately is totally justified. I hope you found a bathroom and scrubbed that sensation away quickly!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I finally finished that 20-page paper I've been dreading for weeks! It feels like a massive weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I can actually sleep tonight.", "output": "That is amazing news! Finishing a huge project like that is such a relief and a great accomplishment. You absolutely deserve a restful night of sleep and maybe a little treat to celebrate getting it done. Enjoy that light feeling!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I've been feeling really lonely lately. Everyone else seems to have their own tight-knit friend groups, and I'm just kind of floating around on the outside. It sucks.", "output": "I hear you, and I want you to know that feeling lonely at school is a very common, albeit painful, experience. It can seem like everyone else is sorted, but many people are looking for connection just like you. It takes time to find your people, so please be patient with yourself while you navigate this."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I walked into the communal bathroom this morning and it was absolutely gross. People are so messy and it smells terrible. I honestly just wanted to turn around and leave.", "output": "Ugh, that sounds incredibly unpleasant. Starting your day dealing with a mess you didn't make is the worst. It is totally understandable that you'd feel disgusted by that; everyone deserves a clean space to get ready in."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I'm graduating in two months and I still don't have a job lined up. All my friends are posting about their offers on LinkedIn and I feel like I'm falling behind. What if I never find anything?", "output": "The post-graduation uncertainty is so scary, and comparing yourself to others on social media only makes it harder. Please remember that everyone's timeline is different and finding the right fit takes time. You are not falling behind; you are just on your own unique path. Take it one application at a time."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I don't really have much going on today. Just sitting in the library staring out the window. Not happy, not sad, just kind of bored.", "output": "Sometimes those quiet, boring moments are actually a nice break for our brains. It is okay to just exist and do nothing for a little while. Maybe looking out the window is exactly the recharge you need right now."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: My parents called and we got into a huge argument about my major. They think I'm wasting my time studying art. It hurts that they don't support my passion.", "output": "It is deeply painful when the people we care about don't support our dreams. You want them to be proud, but you also need to be true to yourself. It takes a lot of courage to pursue art, and your passion is valid regardless of their approval. I'm sorry you had to go through that call."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I just got my grade back for the biology quiz and I got an A! I thought I completely failed it because I didn't study much. I'm in total shock.", "output": "What a wonderful surprise! It sounds like you retained more information than you gave yourself credit for. Sometimes we underestimate our own abilities. Enjoy this unexpected win!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: We have a group project due on Friday and one guy hasn't answered a single text. We're going to have to do all his work for him and he's still going to get the grade. It makes me so mad.", "output": "That is infuriating. It is really unfair when someone rides on the coattails of your hard work without contributing. You have every right to be angry about the injustice of the situation. Hopefully, you can focus on getting your part done for your own peace of mind."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I tried out for the club soccer team and didn't make the cut. I played all through high school and thought I was good enough. I feel really embarrassed.", "output": "Rejection stings, especially when it involves something you love and identify with. It is okay to mourn that loss and feel disappointed. Not making the team doesn't erase your years of skill or your love for the game. Be kind to yourself today."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: My bank account is looking really low and rent is due next week. I'm waiting on my paycheck but I'm scared it won't come in time. The stress is eating me alive.", "output": "Financial stress is one of the heaviest burdens to carry. It makes total sense that you feel anxious about making ends meet. Try to take things one moment at a time, and remember that you have handled difficult situations before. I hope the timing works out for you."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: My long-distance best friend just surprised me with a visit! I haven't seen her in six months. I'm so excited I can't stop smiling.", "output": "That is the best kind of surprise! Reconnecting with a best friend after so long is such a joy. I hope you two have a fantastic time catching up and making new memories together. Soak up every moment!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: My lab partner keeps chewing gum with their mouth open right next to my ear. The sound is driving me up the wall. It's so rude.", "output": "Misophonia is real! That smacking sound can be incredibly irritating and distracting, especially when you are trying to focus. It is tough when people aren't aware of their surroundings. I hope the lab ends quickly for you."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel like I'm just average at everything. I'm not the smartest, not the funniest, not the most talented. I just feel invisible sometimes.", "output": "Feeling like you don't stand out is a heavy and lonely feeling. But please remember that you don't have to be the 'best' at something to be worthy of love and attention. You have a unique mix of qualities that makes you who you are, and that is enough."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I think I might have accidentally offended my professor in an email. I was trying to be funny but reading it back, it sounds sarcastic. I'm scared to go to class now.", "output": "Email anxiety is very common because tone is so hard to convey in text. Most professors are used to awkward student emails and likely won't read into it as much as you are. It will probably be okay, but if it bothers you, a quick follow-up clarifying your intent might help you feel better."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I have a lot of homework to do, but I'm currently just lying in bed scrolling through my phone. I know I should move, but I just can't bring myself to start.", "output": "Procrastination often happens when we are overwhelmed or just need a break. It is okay to have low-energy moments. Maybe try doing just one tiny task, like opening your book, and see if that helps break the inertia. If not, maybe you just need the rest."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: The internet cut out right in the middle of my online quiz! I lost ten minutes trying to reconnect. I'm so mad at the unreliable wifi on this campus.", "output": "Oh no, that is a nightmare scenario! Technology failing at a critical moment is incredibly stressful and rage-inducing. It is completely valid to be angry at the situation. Hopefully, your professor will be understanding if you explain what happened."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I went through a breakup a few weeks ago. I thought I was over it, but I saw a picture of them today and just started crying. I feel like I'm moving backwards.", "output": "Healing isn't a straight line; it often comes in waves. Seeing a photo can definitely trigger all those old feelings, and that doesn't mean you aren't making progress. It just means you are human and you cared. Let the tears come; it's part of the process."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I finally understood the chemistry concept I've been struggling with for weeks. It just clicked in my brain during the lecture today!", "output": "That 'aha!' moment is such a satisfying feeling! It is a testament to your persistence and hard work. It feels great when the fog clears and things finally make sense. Great job sticking with it!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I'm walking home from the library alone and it's really dark. I know it's probably fine, but I feel kind of on edge.", "output": "Your safety instincts are kicking in, which is a good thing, even if it feels scary. It is always okay to be cautious. maybe call a friend or stay on the phone with someone until you get back to your dorm safely. You'll be home soon."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I saw a huge cockroach in the hallway of my dorm. I literally screamed. I hate bugs so much, I feel like my skin is crawling.", "output": "Ew, that is definitely a startle! Feeling like your skin is crawling is a very natural reaction to seeing something like that in your living space. Hopefully, facilities can take care of it soon so you can relax."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I missed my little sister's birthday party because I couldn't afford the train ticket home. She said it was okay, but I can tell she's disappointed. I feel like a bad sibling.", "output": "Guilt is a tough emotion, especially when it involves family. Please try to forgive yourself; being a student often means having tight finances and making hard sacrifices. Your sister loves you, and you can make it up to her with a special call or a visit when you can."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: I was waiting in line for coffee for 20 minutes and someone just cut right in front of me. I didn't say anything, but I'm fuming inside.", "output": "That is so rude! It is really frustrating when people lack basic situational awareness or courtesy. It makes sense that you are angry, especially after waiting so long. Venting about it here is a good way to let that steam off safely."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I just found $20 in a jacket pocket I haven't worn since last winter. I totally forgot I put it there!", "output": "That is the best kind of surprise! It's like a little gift from your past self to your present self. It definitely brightens up the day. Enjoy spending it on something fun!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel really burnt out. I'm working part-time and taking a full course load, and I'm just exhausted all the time. I don't know how much longer I can keep this up.", "output": "It sounds like you are carrying an incredible amount of weight right now. Burnout is your body and mind telling you that you need rest. It is scary to feel like you are running on empty. Please try to find even small moments for yourself, because you matter more than your productivity."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: My parents are coming to visit this weekend and they are very critical of my room and my grades. I'm anxious about everything having to be perfect.", "output": "The pressure to please critical parents can be overwhelming. It makes sense that you are feeling anxious about their visit. Remember that you are doing your best, and their criticism is a reflection of them, not your worth. protect your peace as best you can while they are there."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I just watched a video of a dog jumping on a trampoline and it made my entire day. It was so pure and funny.", "output": "Animals have such a special way of lifting our spirits! It is the little things like a funny dog video that can turn a mood around. I'm glad you found a moment of pure joy in your day."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: Just woke up. Still trying to figure out what day it is. Need coffee before I can function.", "output": "The morning fog is real! Take your time waking up. There is no rush to figure everything out before that first cup of coffee. Hope your day starts smoothly once the caffeine kicks in."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm just watching the rain fall outside. It's kind of grey and gloomy, but peaceful.", "output": "Rainy days have a special kind of cozy energy. It is like the world is giving you permission to slow down and stay inside. Watching the rain can be very mesmerizing and calming. Enjoy the peaceful gloom."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have to present my final project tomorrow and I'm terrified. What if I forget my lines or everyone laughs at me?", "output": "It is completely normal to feel anxious before a big presentation; public speaking is a common fear for so many people. Your feelings are valid, but try to remind yourself that you have prepared for this. Most of the time, the audience is rooting for you, not waiting for you to fail. maybe try some deep breathing exercises to help ground yourself before you start. You’ve got this!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I finally got an A on my calculus exam! I studied for two weeks straight and it actually paid off.", "output": "That is fantastic news! Seeing your hard work result in such a great success must feel incredibly rewarding. You put in the effort and dedication, and you should be really proud of yourself. Make sure you take a little time to celebrate this victory!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: I held the door for someone and they didn't even say thank you. People are so rude.", "output": "That is a small thing that really gets under your skin! It costs nothing to be polite, and when people ignore common courtesy, it feels like a personal slight. It is annoying that your kindness wasn't acknowledged. Don't let their bad manners stop you from being a good person, though."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I found out my so-called 'best friend' has been spreading rumors about me behind my back. I feel sick just thinking about it.", "output": "That is a deeply hurtful betrayal, and feeling disgusted by that behavior is a very natural reaction. Trust is the foundation of friendship, and having that broken is incredibly painful. You deserve friends who lift you up and respect you, not ones who tear you down. It might be time to re-evaluate who deserves access to your energy."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: Just another day, I guess. Wake up, go to class, eat, sleep. It feels like I'm on autopilot.", "output": "It sounds like things are feeling a bit repetitive and mundane for you right now. Sometimes getting stuck in a routine can make life feel a bit gray. If you're up for it, maybe trying one small new thing today could break the cycle? Even a short walk in a new place or a different coffee order might help shift the momentum."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: My parents actually agreed to let me change my major. I was ready for a huge fight, but they were... supportive?", "output": "Wow, that is a pleasant surprise! It sounds like a huge weight has been lifted off your shoulders. It’s great that they were able to listen and support your decision, even when you expected the opposite. This is a big step toward pursuing what you really want!"}

What's wrong with me?", "output": "I hear how lonely and isolating this experience is for you, but please know there is nothing 'wrong' with you. Transitioning to a new environment takes time, and what you see on social media isn't always the full picture. Many people feel the same way but don't show it. Be patient with yourself; authentic connections take time to build."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I'm graduating in two months and I have no job lined up. I feel like I'm going to be a failure while everyone else moves on.", "output": "The transition from school to the career world is terrifying and full of uncertainty. It is very common to not have everything figured out before graduation, even if it seems like everyone else does. Your path is your own, and it's okay if it takes a little longer to find the right footing. Try to focus on what you can control today rather than the 'what ifs' of tomorrow."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: The professor changed the project requirements two days before the deadline! How is that even fair? We've been working on this for a month!", "output": "That sounds incredibly unfair and stressful. It is completely reasonable to be angry when the goalposts are moved at the last minute. It invalidates a lot of the planning and hard work you've already put in. Is there a way for the class to provide collective feedback to the administration or the professor?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: My little sister called me today just to say hi. We haven't talked in a while, and it just made my whole week.", "output": "That sounds like such a sweet and heartwarming moment! Reconnecting with family can really brighten your spirits and make you feel grounded. It’s lovely that a simple call could bring you so much joy. I hope you can hold onto that warm feeling for a while."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm trying to decide between studying abroad or taking a summer internship. Both seem okay, I just can't pick.", "output": "It sounds like you are at a crossroads with two solid options, which can actually be quite paralyzing. It's okay to sit with the indecision for a bit while you weigh the pros and cons. Maybe visualize how you want to feel at the end of the summer—does one path excite you more than the other?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I walked into the communal kitchen and the sink was clogged with old food. It smelled so bad I had to leave immediately.", "output": "That sounds absolutely revolting. Living in shared spaces can be really difficult when hygiene standards aren't met by everyone. It’s frustrating to have your living environment impacted like that. Hopefully, you can find a cleaner space to prepare your food or address this with housing services."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I just realized I've been reading the wrong chapters for the midterm. I can't believe I missed that on the syllabus.", "output": "That is definitely a shock, and I can imagine your stomach dropped when you realized. It happens to the best of us when we're juggling so much information. Try not to panic; now that you know, you can pivot and focus on the right material. Is there still enough time to cover the key concepts?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: My dog back home passed away this morning. I feel so guilty that I wasn't there with him at the end.", "output": "I am so deeply sorry for your loss. Losing a pet is losing a family member, and the distance makes the grief even harder to bear. Please don't blame yourself; your dog knew he was loved by you. Allow yourself to grieve in whatever way you need to right now."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I found a twenty dollar bill in my winter coat pocket! I completely forgot I put it there.", "output": "That is the best kind of surprise! It is like a little gift from your past self to your present self. Finding 'free' money always brightens the day. You should definitely treat yourself to a fancy coffee or lunch with your windfall!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: I keep getting interrupted in class whenever I try to speak. It feels like my opinion doesn't matter to anyone.", "output": "That is extremely frustrating and disrespectful. Your voice and your ideas deserve to be heard just as much as anyone else's. It makes sense that you'd feel angry about being silenced repeatedly. You might consider speaking to the instructor privately about what's happening, as they should be facilitating a fair discussion."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I finally cleaned my room! It was a mess for weeks, but now I can actually see the floor. I feel so much lighter.", "output": "Great job! It’s amazing how much our physical environment can affect our mental headspace. Clearing that clutter is a real accomplishment, especially when you’ve been putting it off. Enjoy that feeling of lightness and the fresh space you've created for yourself!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm just reading a book right now. It's quiet in the library. Not much else going on.", "output": "That sounds like a peaceful moment. Sometimes a quiet pause in the library is exactly what is needed to recharge. Enjoy your reading and the calm atmosphere."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: A guy at the party kept touching my arm even after I moved away. It was so creepy and gross.", "output": "I am so sorry you had to experience that; it is completely unacceptable. Your body is your own, and ignoring your non-verbal cues is a violation of your boundaries. Feeling disgusted and 'creeped out' is a valid protective response. You did the right thing by moving away."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I won the raffle at the student union! I never win anything. I got a $50 gift card!", "output": "No way! That is such a fun and unexpected surprise. It’s always a nice feeling when luck strikes when you least expect it. Do you have any ideas on what you’re going to spend the gift card on?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I just feel like I'm not smart enough for this program. Everyone else talks about complex theories and I'm just lost.", "output": "Imposter syndrome is so heavy and painful to deal with. It’s easy to compare your internal struggles with everyone else's external confidence. Feeling lost doesn't mean you aren't smart enough; it just means you're learning, which is exactly what you're there to do. You belong there just as much as anyone else."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I think I might have accidentally plagiarized a sentence in my essay. I submitted it an hour ago and now I'm spiraling.", "output": "That panic is very real, but try to take a slow breath. Usually, academic integrity policies distinguish between honest mistakes and malicious intent. If it was just one sentence and you're worried, you could proactively email your professor to explain the oversight. Honesty often goes a long way in these situations."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My group partner didn't do their half of the slides, so I had to stay up until 3 AM finishing it. I'm exhausted and furious.", "output": "I don't blame you for being furious; that is completely unfair. You shouldn't have to sacrifice your sleep and well-being to cover for someone else's lack of responsibility. It shows your dedication that you finished it, but you have every right to address this imbalance with your partner or the professor."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I tried a new recipe for dinner and it actually tasted like home. I missed my mom's cooking so much.", "output": "That is so lovely! Food has such a powerful connection to memory and comfort. Being able to recreate a taste of home is a special skill. It sounds like a really nurturing evening for you."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I have a few hours before my next class. Might just scroll on my phone or take a nap.", "output": "Having some unstructured downtime can be nice. Whether you choose to rest your eyes or just zone out for a bit, I hope it helps you recharge for your next class."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I saw someone cheating on the test today. It makes me so mad that I study so hard and they just take the easy way out.", "output": "It is really disheartening to see dishonesty like that. It feels like a slap in the face to your own hard work and integrity. It makes sense that you'd feel disgust toward that behavior. Just remember that your grades are a reflection of your actual learning, which is something no one can fake."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I ran into my old high school teacher at the grocery store here. I didn't even know they moved to this city!", "output": "What a small world! That must have been such a double-take moment for you. It’s always jarring to see figures from your past in a completely new context. Was it a nice reunion?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: It's my birthday today and nobody remembered. I've just been in my room all day waiting for a text that never came.", "output": "I am so incredibly sorry. That is a heartbreaking feeling, and you deserve to be celebrated and remembered on your special day. It is okay to feel hurt and disappointed by this. Happy Birthday from me—I know it’s not the same, but I’m glad you’re here. You are important."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel like I'm drifting apart from my high school friends. We don't have much to say to each other anymore.", "output": "That is a very common but painful part of growing up. As you all evolve and take different paths, the common ground shrinks. It doesn't mean the friendship wasn't real or important, but mourning the loss of that closeness is natural. It is hard to let go of what used to be."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have to give a presentation in 10 minutes and I feel like I'm going to throw up.", "output": "That pre-presentation adrenaline is intense! Your body is in fight-or-flight mode. Try to take slow, deep breaths to signal to your brain that you are safe. You have prepared for this. Once you start speaking, the nerves usually settle down. You can get through this."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: My presentation is tomorrow morning and I'm terrified. I keep imagining myself freezing up in front of the whole class and everyone laughing at me.", "output": "It is completely normal to feel nervous before a big presentation; that anticipation can be really intense. Try to take a few deep breaths and remind yourself that you have prepared for this. Remember, your classmates are likely focused on their own work, not judging you."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My roommate ate my leftovers again! I specifically labeled them with my name. It's so disrespectful and I'm sick of having to hide my own food in my own apartment.", "output": "That sounds incredibly frustrating and unfair. It is important to feel respected in your own living space, and having your boundaries crossed like that would make anyone angry. Maybe when you're feeling calmer, you can have a serious conversation about boundaries."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I finally got the internship I applied for! I've been waiting weeks to hear back, and I honestly didn't think I'd get it. I'm so relieved!", "output": "That is absolutely wonderful news! Congratulations on landing the internship; your patience and hard work have clearly paid off. Take some time to celebrate this achievement—you deserve it!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: The cafeteria food was absolutely gross today. It looked undercooked and smelled weird. I lost my appetite immediately and now I'm just hungry and annoyed.", "output": "I'm sorry to hear that your lunch experience was so unpleasant. It is really disappointing when you're hungry and the food is unappealing. Hopefully, you can find a snack or a better meal later to make up for it."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: Just finished my last class for the day. I'm going to head to the library to do some reading before dinner. Nothing much else going on.", "output": "It sounds like you have a productive evening ahead of you. Getting some reading done before dinner is a great way to stay on top of things. I hope you have a quiet and focused study session."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I ran into my old best friend from high school at the coffee shop today. I had no idea she moved to this city! It was such a shock.", "output": "What an unexpected and pleasant surprise! It must have been wild to see a familiar face in a new place like that. I hope it was a nice reunion for you both."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: Everyone in my dorm seems to have made close friends already except me. I spend most of my weekends alone in my room watching Netflix. I feel so lonely.", "output": "I hear the loneliness in your words, and I want you to know that what you're feeling is very common, even if it doesn't look like it. Building deep friendships takes time, and it's okay that you haven't found your group yet. You are worthy of connection, and this phase won't last forever."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I don't know what I want to do after graduation. Everyone else seems to have a plan or a job lined up, and I'm just drifting. I'm scared I'll fail at life.", "output": "The uncertainty of the future can feel very heavy, especially when comparing yourself to others. It is okay not to have everything figured out right now; many people find their path at their own pace. Trust that you have time to explore and discover what works for you."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My professor changed the due date for the final project to two days earlier without telling us until today. How is that fair? I had a schedule mapped out!", "output": "That sounds incredibly stressful and unfair to have the rug pulled out from under you like that. It makes sense that you are angry when your planning is disrupted by poor communication. Try to take it one step at a time, and do what you can without burning out."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: My parents just called to say they're coming to visit next weekend. I haven't seen them in three months and I miss them so much.", "output": "That is so exciting! It sounds like this visit is exactly what you needed. I hope you have a wonderful time catching up and making new memories with them next weekend."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: My boyfriend broke up with me via text message this morning. We've been together for a year. I just feel empty and discarded.", "output": "I am so sorry you are going through this; getting broken up with over text is incredibly painful and invalidating. It is okay to feel empty and hurt right now—give yourself permission to grieve the relationship. You deserve to be treated with care and respect."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I saw someone cheating on the exam today. They had notes written on their arm. It makes me sick that I study so hard while others just cheat.", "output": "It is really disheartening to see dishonesty like that when you are putting in honest effort. Your feelings of disgust are valid because you value integrity and fairness. Keep focusing on your own hard work; that integrity will serve you well in the long run."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I think I might have failed my math class. If I did, I'll lose my scholarship. I can't afford tuition without it. I don't know what I'm going to do.", "output": "That is a terrifying possibility to face, and I can imagine how anxious you must be feeling about your scholarship. Take a deep breath; right now, the outcome isn't certain. If the worst happens, there are often advisors and resources to help you figure out the next steps."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm just organizing my notes for the week. Need to buy some highlighters and maybe a new notebook. Just doing chores.", "output": "Getting organized can be very satisfying and sets a great tone for the week ahead. It sounds like you are taking proactive steps to stay on track. Enjoy your trip to the store—sometimes fresh supplies can be a nice little boost."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I actually got an A on that essay I wrote the night before. I thought for sure I'd get a C at best. I'm in shock.", "output": "Wow, that is a great surprise! It sounds like you work better under pressure than you realized. Enjoy that feeling of relief and accomplishment!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel so overwhelmed. I have three papers due, a lab report, and I have to work 20 hours this week. I just want to curl up and sleep for a week.", "output": "That sounds like an incredibly heavy load to carry all at once. It makes total sense that you just want to rest and escape the pressure for a while. Remember to take even tiny breaks just to breathe—you are doing a lot, and your exhaustion is valid."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: My cat actually caught a mouse! I didn't think she had the hunting instinct in her.", "output": "Wow, she really stepped up to the plate! It is surprising when our pampered house pets show their wild side. I guess she earned her keep today! Hopefully, she didn't leave it anywhere too surprising for you to find."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have to go to the dentist today and I hate it. I'm scared they're going to find a cavity or that it will hurt.", "output": "Dental anxiety is very real and really unpleasant. It's brave of you to go despite the fear. Try to listen to some calming music beforehand, and remember that taking care of your health is a positive step, even when it's scary."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I managed to run a full 5k today without stopping! I've been training for two months and I finally hit my goal.", "output": "That is a fantastic achievement! Sticking to a training plan for two months shows real dedication and grit. You should be really proud of your progress and your physical strength."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: My friend keeps making these really rude comments about people's appearances. It's so shallow and mean. I don't think I want to hang out with her anymore.", "output": "It sounds like you are outgrowing that friendship because your values don't align anymore. It is uncomfortable to witness unkindness, and feeling repelled by it shows your empathy. You have the right to surround yourself with people who are kind and uplifting."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: The weather is kind of gray today. I think it might rain later. I should probably bring an umbrella to class.", "output": "Good thinking on checking the weather; it's always better to be prepared than caught in the rain. Gray days can be a bit gloomy, but they can also be cozy for studying indoors."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I miss my dog so much. He's back home with my parents and I haven't seen him since summer. Facetime isn't the same.", "output": "It is so hard being separated from a beloved pet; they really are family. It completely makes sense that you're feeling that absence deeply. Maybe you can ask your parents to send some extra photos or videos to help bridge the gap a little."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: The person next to me on the plane took their shoes and socks off. The smell is awful.", "output": "That is a travel nightmare. Being trapped in a confined space with bad odors is torture. It is incredibly inconsiderate of them to inflict that on fellow passengers. You have every right to be disgusted. I hope the flight is short or you have a scarf to breathe through!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm researching different types of insurance. It's boring but I need to get it sorted.", "output": "That is definitely 'adulting' at its finest. It isn't the most exciting task, but it is so important for your future security. Getting it sorted will give you peace of mind. Good for you for tackling the boring but necessary stuff."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: I got a parking ticket on campus even though I have a permit! The parking enforcement here is a joke. Now I have to waste time appealing it.", "output": "That is incredibly annoying and feels so unjust when you actually followed the rules. Dealing with bureaucracy is a huge hassle, and your frustration is totally justified. I hope the appeal process goes quickly so you can put this behind you."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I tried that new vegan place downtown and it was actually amazing. I usually hate tofu, but this was delicious.", "output": "It is always fun to have your expectations flipped like that! Discovering new foods you enjoy is a great feeling. Now you have a new go-to spot to enjoy."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel like I'm drifting apart from my high school friends. We don't talk as much and our group chat is dead. It feels like losing a part of myself.", "output": "Growing apart is a natural part of life, but that doesn't make it any less painful. It feels like a loss because those friendships hold so many memories. It is okay to grieve those changes while also being open to the new connections you are making now."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I'm worried I chose the wrong major. I'm three years in and I don't know if I even like this field anymore. Is it too late to switch?", "output": "That is a really heavy realization to sit with, and the fear of 'wasted time' is very common. It is rarely too late to pivot or find a new direction, even if it feels overwhelming right now. Many skills are transferable, and your path doesn't have to be a straight line."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I think I'll make pasta for dinner. It's quick and I have a lot of studying to do tonight.", "output": "Pasta sounds like a solid, comforting choice for a busy study night. It's great that you're prioritizing a meal that fuels you without taking up too much time. Good luck with your studying tonight!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel like I'm drowning in coursework and no matter how hard I study, my grades just aren't improving. It makes me feel really stupid and hopeless.", "output": "I hear how overwhelmed and discouraged you're feeling right now. It is incredibly tough when your hard work doesn't seem to be paying off immediately, but that definitely doesn't make you stupid. Please be gentle with yourself; maybe taking a short break could help clear your mind before you try again."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have a huge presentation tomorrow and I'm terrified of messing it up in front of the whole class. My hands are shaking just thinking about it.", "output": "It is completely normal to feel nervous before a big presentation; your body is just reacting to the stress. Try to take a few deep breaths and remember that you have prepared for this. You are capable, and even if you stumble, it doesn't define your worth or your ability."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My roommate ate my food again without asking! I explicitly told them last week that this bothers me, and they just don't respect my boundaries.", "output": "It makes total sense that you are frustrated by that. Having your boundaries ignored, especially in your own home, is really invalidating and disrespectful. It might be helpful to have another calm but firm conversation when you're feeling ready, but for now, your anger is justified."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My roommate used my expensive shampoo again! I've told her to stop so many times.", "output": "That is a clear violation of your boundaries and your property. It is not just about the shampoo; it is about the disrespect of ignoring your requests. It is infuriating to feel like you can't leave your own things in your own bathroom. You might need to keep your toiletries in your room, which is unfair but effective."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I've been feeling really lonely lately. Everyone seems to have their own friend groups, and I'm just on the outside looking in. I miss home.", "output": "Loneliness can be such a heavy and isolating feeling, and it's really hard when you feel like an outsider. Missing home is a natural part of being in a new environment, and it doesn't mean you won't find your people here eventually. Be patient with yourself as you navigate this; you are not alone in feeling this way."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I can't believe how fake some people are. I found out my so-called friend was talking behind my back about my personal life.", "output": "That sounds incredibly hurtful and violating. It is really unpleasant to discover that trust has been broken like that, and feeling disgusted by that behavior is a healthy reaction. You deserve friends who respect your privacy and treat you with genuine kindness."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I'm scared that I picked the wrong major. Everyone else seems so passionate about it, but I just feel lost and unsure if I have a future in this field.", "output": "It is really scary to feel uncertain about your future, especially when comparing yourself to others. Many students go through periods of doubt, and it's okay not to have everything figured out right this second. Trust that you have time to explore your interests and that your path doesn't have to look exactly like everyone else's."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I don't know, I just feel kind of empty today. Not sad, exactly, just like I'm going through the motions and nothing is really interesting.", "output": "Thank you for sharing that with me. Sometimes we have days that feel flat or grey, and that is a valid experience too. It's okay to just exist today without forcing yourself to feel excited or productive; give yourself permission to rest."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I got the highest grade in the class on the midterm! I studied so hard for it.", "output": "That is incredible! All those hours of studying and stress really paid off. It is such a validating feeling to see your hard work reflected in a result like that. You should be incredibly proud of your dedication and intelligence. Celebrate this win!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: My dog passed away yesterday. I've had him since I was a kid and the house feels so quiet and empty without him.", "output": "I am so, so sorry for your loss. Losing a childhood pet is like losing a family member, and the silence they leave behind can be heartbreaking. Please allow yourself to grieve in whatever way feels right for you; your bond with him was special and real."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: My parents are fighting a lot recently and they keep talking about divorce. I don't know what's going to happen to our family.", "output": "That sounds like a really frightening and unstable situation to be living through. It's hard not knowing what the future holds for your family, and it makes sense that you feel scared. Remember to take care of your own heart right now; you aren't responsible for fixing their relationship."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: My best friend surprised me with tickets to a concert for my birthday! I can't believe they did that.", "output": "That is such a sweet and thoughtful gesture! It sounds like you have a really caring friend who values you. Enjoy the anticipation and the concert; moments like these are great reminders of the joy in your life."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I feel so gross about myself today. I skipped the gym for three days and ate junk food, and now I just hate looking in the mirror.", "output": "It sounds like you're being really harsh on yourself right now. Everyone has days where they rest or eat differently, and that doesn't change your worth or make you 'gross.' Try to speak to yourself with the same kindness you would offer a friend who needed a break."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I asked someone out and they rejected me. It was so embarrassing, and now I feel like nobody will ever like me.", "output": "Rejection stings so much, and it's natural to feel embarrassed and hurt in the aftermath. However, one person's 'no' definitely doesn't mean you are unlovable or that you'll be alone forever. Give yourself time to heal from the disappointment, but don't let it dim your view of your own value."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I think I might have offended my boss today with a joke I made. She didn't laugh and now I'm worried I'm going to get fired.", "output": "It's really stressful to replay a moment like that and worry about the consequences. Most of the time, awkward moments aren't career-ending, even if they feel huge in our heads. Try to distract yourself for now; if things seem normal tomorrow, it was likely just a small bump."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: Just finished my last exam. I thought I'd be happier, but I'm just tired.", "output": "That is a very common reaction to the end of a stressful period. Sometimes the exhaustion hits before the celebration does. It is completely okay to just feel drained and need sleep rather than a party right now."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: I'm stuck doing the entire group project by myself because everyone else is 'too busy.' It's completely unfair.", "output": "You have every right to be angry about that situation. Group projects are difficult enough without carrying the entire load for people who aren't pulling their weight. It's exhausting to be the responsible one, and your frustration is completely valid."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I miss my high school friends. We promised to stay in touch, but the group chat has been dead for months.", "output": "Growing apart is a really painful part of moving into new stages of life. It hurts to feel that distance growing despite promises to stay close. It doesn't erase the good memories you have, but it's okay to mourn the change in those relationships."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have to make a phone call to the bank to sort out a fraud alert and I hate talking on the phone. I've been putting it off for hours.", "output": "Phone anxiety is very real and can make tasks like this feel like mountains. It's okay that you've been delaying it; it's a stressful thing to deal with. Maybe write down a script of what you need to say first to help you feel more prepared?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I cooked a real meal for the first time today instead of just instant noodles. It actually tasted good!", "output": "That is a fantastic small victory! Cooking for yourself is a great form of self-care, and it's awesome that it turned out delicious. You should be proud of stepping out of your routine and making something nice for yourself."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: The dorm bathrooms are absolutely filthy this weekend. People are so messy and it makes me not even want to shower.", "output": "That sounds really unpleasant and frustrating to live with. Your living space has a big impact on your mood, and having to deal with other people's mess is genuinely gross. I hope the cleaning schedule cycles through soon so you can feel comfortable again."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel like I'm not good enough for my partner. They are so smart and successful, and I'm just struggling to get by.", "output": "It sounds like you are dealing with some heavy insecurities, and that is really painful. Please remember that a relationship is about connection, not a résumé comparison. You bring your own unique value to the partnership, even if you can't see it clearly right now."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I'm spending my birthday alone this year. I know it's just a day, but it feels lonely.", "output": "It is not 'just a day'\u9225\u650at is your day, and being alone on a day that celebrates you can feel really isolating. It is okay to feel sad about it. Maybe you can plan a perfect 'me day' with your favorite food and movies? You deserve to be celebrated, even if you are the one throwing the party for yourself."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My parents keep comparing me to my older brother. 'Why can't you be more like him?' I'm so sick of it!", "output": "That is incredibly hurtful and infuriating to hear. You are your own person with your own strengths, and you shouldn't have to live in anyone's shadow. It is completely fair to feel angry when your individuality isn't being respected or appreciated."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I'm just really tired of everything. School, work, expectations. It feels like I'm running on a treadmill that never stops.", "output": "It sounds like you are experiencing some serious burnout. Carrying all those expectations and responsibilities is exhausting, and it's okay to admit that it's too much right now. I hope you can find a small pocket of time soon to just stop and breathe without any demands."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I actually passed the class I thought I was failing! I opened the grade portal and gasped.", "output": "What a wonderful surprise! It sounds like your hard work paid off in ways you didn't expect, or perhaps you were underestimating yourself. Enjoy this feeling of relief and success!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I found a lump on my neck and I'm Googling symptoms. I'm convinced it's something terrible.", "output": "Health scares are terrifying, and searching online often makes the anxiety much worse. It is completely understandable that you are frightened. The best thing you can do for your peace of mind is to see a doctor who can give you real answers, rather than letting the internet scare you further."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: The WiFi cut out right in the middle of my online exam submission! I'm freaking out and so mad at the university internet.", "output": "That is a nightmare scenario and you have every right to be panicked and angry. Technical issues during high-stakes moments are incredibly unfair. Take a screenshot if you can and email your professor immediately; most will understand that technology fails sometimes."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel like I'm drifting apart from my family. We don't talk much anymore and when we do, it's just awkward.", "output": "Feeling a disconnect from your family can be a deeply lonely experience. It's sad when those natural bonds start to feel strained or distant. Sometimes relationships have seasons of distance, but it doesn't mean the connection is gone forever."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I just had the best coffee date with a new friend. We talked for three hours straight!", "output": "That sounds like such a refreshing and happy experience! Connecting with someone new and having the conversation flow so easily is one of the best feelings. I'm glad you had that time to recharge and socialize."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I studied for two weeks straight for this chemistry exam, and I still blanked out when I saw the questions. I feel like such a failure.", "output": "I hear how incredibly frustrating and disappointing that feels, especially after putting in so much effort. It is completely normal to feel defeated when hard work doesn't immediately pay off, but please remember that one test does not define your intelligence or your potential. Be kind to yourself tonight; you did your best, and that matters. Maybe take the evening off to recharge before you look at the material again."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have to give a presentation in my seminar tomorrow, and I'm terrified of public speaking. My hands start shaking just thinking about it.", "output": "It is completely understandable to feel nervous about public speaking; so many people feel the exact same way. That physical reaction is just your body's way of showing you care about doing a good job. Try to focus on just getting through the first minute, as the anxiety often settles down once you get started. You have prepared for this, and no matter what happens, you will get through it."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My roommate borrowed my headphones without asking again and left them at the library. I am so sick of her not respecting my stuff.", "output": "That sounds incredibly annoying and disrespectful of your boundaries. It is totally valid to feel angry when someone takes your personal belongings without permission, especially when it keeps happening. You deserve to have your property respected in your own home. When you feel calmer, it might be worth having a firm conversation about boundaries, but for now, let yourself vent that frustration."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I finally got the call back for the internship I applied to! I was so sure I messed up the interview, but they want me!", "output": "That is absolutely amazing news! I am so happy for you; it sounds like all your preparation really paid off despite your worries. You should be really proud of yourself for putting yourself out there and succeeding. Make sure to do something nice for yourself today to celebrate this win!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I walked into the communal kitchen and the sink was full of old, moldy dishes. It smells awful and I just lost my appetite completely.", "output": "Ugh, that sounds absolutely gross and very unpleasant to deal with. It is totally reasonable to feel disgusted and frustrated when shared spaces aren't kept clean. It's hard to feel comfortable or hungry when your environment feels unsanitary. Maybe you can grab a snack somewhere else for now so you don't have to deal with that mess immediately."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: All my friends are going away for the weekend, but I have to work. I feel so left out and lonely sitting in my room.", "output": "I'm sorry you're feeling left out; the 'fear of missing out' is a really painful feeling. It is hard to see everyone else having fun while you're stuck with responsibilities. Try to plan a small treat for yourself after work, like a favorite movie or a good meal, so you have something to look forward to as well. You aren't alone in feeling this way, and there will be other weekends for fun."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I actually passed my math final. I was convinced I was going to fail the class, but I scraped by with a C.", "output": "Wow, what a relief that must be for you! It sounds like a huge weight has been lifted off your shoulders. Even if it wasn't the perfect grade, passing a difficult class is a genuine accomplishment. Take a deep breath and enjoy the fact that this stress is finally behind you."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I don't really feel like doing anything today. I'm not sad, just kind of bored and unmotivated.", "output": "It is totally okay to have days where you just feel flat or unmotivated. Sometimes our brains just need a little downtime to reset, even if it feels like boredom. You don't have to be productive every single moment. Maybe just listen to some music or go for a short walk to change up the scenery, but don't pressure yourself too much."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I heard rumors of layoffs at my company. I'm terrified I might lose my job.", "output": "That kind of uncertainty is incredibly stressful. Waiting for the other shoe to drop creates a constant background hum of anxiety. It is scary to feel like your livelihood is at risk. Try to focus on what you can control\u9225\u6517pdating your resume or networking\u9225\u6514ather than the 'what ifs.' Hang in there."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel like I'm drifting apart from my best friend from high school. We barely text anymore, and it hurts.", "output": "Growing apart from a close friend is a very specific and deep kind of heartache. It is really painful to feel that connection fading, especially when you share so much history. This happens often during life transitions, but it doesn't make it hurt any less. It might be worth sending a message just to say you miss them, but also be gentle with yourself as you navigate this change."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I tried a new haircut and I actually love it! I was so scared to cut it short.", "output": "That is a great feeling! Taking a risk with your appearance requires courage, and it is such a relief when it pays off. A new haircut can give you a whole new boost of confidence. Rock that new look!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: Some guy at the party wouldn't leave me alone even after I said no. I feel gross just thinking about it.", "output": "I am so sorry that happened to you; that is completely unacceptable behavior on his part. You have every right to feel disgusted and violated by someone ignoring your boundaries. Please remind yourself that you did nothing wrong and that his actions are entirely his fault. Be extra kind to yourself today and stick close to people who make you feel safe and respected."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: My art project got chosen for the student showcase! I've never had my work displayed publicly before.", "output": "That is fantastic! Congratulations on having your talent recognized in such a public way. It is a huge validation of your creativity and hard work. Enjoy the showcase and soak in the moment—you absolutely deserve this spotlight."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I'm worried I picked the wrong major. Everyone else seems to love their classes, but I'm struggling to stay interested.", "output": "It is really common to question your path, especially when you compare your insides to everyone else's outsides. It feels scary to think you might have to change direction, but nothing is set in stone. You have time to explore and figure out what truly lights you up. Maybe you can speak to an advisor, but for now, try not to panic; this uncertainty is part of the journey."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I look in the mirror and I just hate what I see. I feel like everyone is prettier and thinner than me.", "output": "I hear how much pain you are in right now, and my heart goes out to you. It is so hard when our inner critic becomes so loud and cruel. Please try to remember that your worth is not defined by your reflection or by comparing yourself to others. You bring so much value to the world just by being you, even if it's hard to see that right now."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: My strict dad actually agreed to let me go on the spring break trip. I was ready for a fight, but he just said yes.", "output": "That is a pleasant surprise! It must feel great to have that conflict you were anticipating just vanish. It sounds like he is starting to trust your judgment more. Enjoy the feeling of relief and have a wonderful time planning your trip!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: Just finished all my exams. Now I'm sitting here and I don't know what to do with myself.", "output": "That is a very common feeling after a high-stress period ends; it's like the adrenaline suddenly drops. It can feel strange to have free time again. You don't have to fill the silence immediately. Maybe just rest, catch up on sleep, or watch a show you've been putting off. Enjoy the freedom of having nothing to do."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My group project partner ghosted us, and now I have to do his part of the work tonight. I'm fuming.", "output": "That is maddening; it is so unfair that his irresponsibility is falling on your shoulders. You are completely justified in feeling angry about having to pick up the slack. Do what you need to do to get it done, but make sure to let your instructor know what happened. You shouldn't have to carry the weight for someone else without credit."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I opened a bag of chips and found a dead bug inside. I'm never buying that brand again.", "output": "That is horrifying! It completely ruins your appetite and trust in the product. Finding a foreign object in your food is a major shock. You are totally right to boycott that brand; that is a serious quality control failure. Ugh!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have a meeting with the Dean regarding a mistake on my application. I'm scared I'm going to get kicked out.", "output": "That sounds absolutely terrifying; the uncertainty of administrative issues can be overwhelming. It is easy for our minds to jump to the worst-case scenario, but often these things are solvable errors. Try to breathe and take it one step at a time. You will go to the meeting, explain your side, and handle whatever comes next, but you don't have to solve it all in your head right now."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm just watering my plants. It's a nice little routine I have every Sunday.", "output": "Plant care can be so therapeutic. It is a quiet, nurturing moment in your week where you connect with nature. Watching them grow and thrive because of your care is a simple but profound satisfaction. Enjoy your Sunday ritual."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: The restaurant got my order wrong and then argued with me about it! I was so polite too.", "output": "That is the worst customer service experience. It is one thing to make a mistake, but to argue with the customer about it is completely unprofessional. It feels so unjust when you are polite and still get treated poorly. You have every right to be angry and maybe leave a bad review."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel like I'm barely keeping my head above water with my classes. I'm tired all the time and I just want to cry.", "output": "I can hear how exhausted and overwhelmed you are. It is really hard when it feels like you are running on empty and still can't catch up. Please listen to your body and your emotions; crying is a valid way to release stress. Is there one small thing you can drop or delay just to give yourself an hour of rest? You matter more than your grades."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm thinking about joining the hiking club. I've never hiked before, but I need a hobby.", "output": "That sounds like a really cool idea! Trying something completely new is a great way to break up the routine and meet new people. Everyone has to start somewhere, so don't worry about being a beginner. It might be refreshing to get out into nature and clear your head."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: My baby nephew smiled at me for the first time today! It was the cutest thing ever.", "output": "That is a heart-melting moment!

{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel like I'm stuck in a rut. Every day is the same and I'm not going anywhere.", "output": "That feeling of stagnation is really draining. It is hard when life feels like a loop with no forward momentum. Please know that 'ruts' are often periods of rest or gestation before a change. You don't have to change everything at once; maybe one small new thing could help break the cycle?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: My mom sent me a care package with homemade cookies. It made my whole week.", "output": "That is so heartwarming! There is nothing quite like a care package to make you feel loved and remembered. It sounds like a wonderful surprise that brought a little piece of home to you. Enjoy your cookies and the warm feeling that comes with them!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel really homesick today. I miss my bed, my family, and just knowing where everything is.", "output": "Homesickness comes in waves, and it sounds like a big wave hit you today. It is really hard to be in a new place where everything requires effort, and you just crave the comfort of the familiar. It's okay to have days where you just miss home. Maybe give your family a call or cook a meal that reminds you of them to bridge the distance a little."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I ran into my ex today and it wasn't awkward at all. We actually had a nice, normal conversation.", "output": "That is a really pleasant surprise! It is often so anxiety-inducing to think about seeing an ex, so having it go smoothly is a huge relief. It shows a lot of growth and healing on both sides. It's great that you can move forward without that heavy awkwardness hanging over you."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I think I might have failed a prerequisite class. If I did, I have to stay an extra semester and pay more tuition.", "output": "That is a really scary possibility to face, especially with the financial implications involved. It makes sense that your mind is racing with the 'what ifs.' Try to wait until you have the actual grades before spiraling too far, though I know that is hard. Even if the worst happens, there is always a path forward, but for now, just breathe and take it day by day."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I studied so hard for that calculus exam, but I still failed. I feel like I'm just not smart enough for this major, and it's really discouraging.", "output": "I'm so sorry to hear about your exam; it's incredibly frustrating when hard work doesn't yield the results you hoped for.

I'm so tired of cleaning up after them, it's so disrespectful.", "output": "It sounds really exhausting to deal with that mess constantly, and your frustration is completely valid. Living with others can be tough, especially when boundaries aren't respected. When you're feeling calmer, it might be worth having an open conversation with your roommate to set some clear expectations."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I've just been feeling kind of meh lately. Nothing is really wrong, but I don't have much energy to do anything other than scroll on my phone.", "output": "It's okay to have days or even weeks where things feel a bit flat or low-energy. sometimes our bodies and minds just need a period of rest and unproductiveness.

I feel really lonely and I'm scared I've lost her friendship.", "output": "I can hear how much this hurts, and it makes sense that you are feeling lonely and worried right now. Friendships have their ups and downs, and sometimes people just need a little space to cool off. Hang in there, and try to be kind to yourself while you wait for the dust to settle."}

I hate how gross the food options are here sometimes.", "output": "That sounds like a really unpleasant experience; bad smells can definitely ruin your appetite instantly.

I miss my family and my dog, and being here just feels so cold and unfamiliar.", "output": "Homesickness is such a heavy feeling, and it is completely natural to miss the comfort of your family and pets. It speaks to how much you love them. Perhaps giving them a call or looking at some favorite photos could bring a little bit of that warmth to you right now."}

It's so unfair.", "output": "That sounds incredibly frustrating, especially when you know you did the right thing. It is hard to be patient when you feel like you are being treated unfairly.

It makes me sick that someone can be so two-faced.", "output": "Discovering that kind of betrayal is really painful and it is natural to feel disgusted by that behavior.

Everyone else is going on dates, and I'm just always the third wheel.", "output": "It can be really isolating to feel like the odd one out, and your feelings of loneliness are valid.

{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I went to a party last night and felt so awkward. I'm worried everyone thought I was weird because I didn't talk much.", "output": "Social anxiety can make us relive moments and judge ourselves harshly, but usually, others don't notice the things we worry about.

It looked so gross I had to throw it all away.", "output": "That is so disappointing, especially when you put effort into making a meal.

{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have to get a shot today and I hate needles. I faint every time.", "output": "Needle phobia is very real and very physical. The anticipation is often the worst part. Be sure to tell the nurse you are prone to fainting; they can let you lie down and help you through it. It will be over in a second, but the fear leading up to it is valid. Breathe through it."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: The internet went out right in the middle of my online game. We were winning, and now I probably got a penalty for disconnecting.", "output": "That is incredibly annoying! Technical issues always seem to happen at the worst possible moments.

I studied for two weeks straight, and now I feel like I'm just not smart enough for this major.", "output": "I hear how disappointed and discouraged you are feeling right now.

I keep imagining myself forgetting everything and everyone laughing at me.", "output": "It is completely understandable to feel anxious before a big presentation; public speaking is a common fear for so many people.

Try to take a few deep breaths and remind yourself that you have prepared for this moment."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My roommate ate my leftovers again without asking. I labeled them and everything! It's so disrespectful.", "output": "It sounds really frustrating to have your boundaries crossed like that, especially when you made it clear the food was yours.

It's completely unfair and now I have to redo everything.", "output": "That sounds incredibly stressful and unfair. It is completely reasonable to feel angry when the goalposts are moved at the last minute. Take a moment to vent that frustration, and then perhaps tackle the changes one step at a time."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: My best friend surprised me with tickets to a concert for my birthday! I'm so excited.", "output": "That is such a sweet and thoughtful gesture from your friend! It sounds like you have a wonderful friendship and a fun night to look forward to.

{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: Everyone around me seems so sure of what they want to do with their lives, and I have no idea. I feel like I'm falling behind.", "output": "It is very common to feel like everyone else has it figured out, but the truth is many people are just as uncertain. Life is not a race, and it is okay to take the time you need to explore your interests. You are exactly where you need to be right now."}

I feel like I did something wrong or that they don't want to be friends anymore.", "output": "That sounds really painful and isolating.

It is frustrating when people don't respect others' property. You have every right to be upset about having to buy more because of someone else's dishonesty."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: My professor wrote a really nice comment on my essay. She said my arguments were insightful.", "output": "That is wonderful recognition! It feels so good to have your hard work and critical thinking validated. You should be proud of your academic growth."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: The person sitting next to me in the library was chewing so loudly. I literally had to move tables.", "output": "Misophonia is real! It can be so distracting and irritating when you are trying to focus. Moving tables was a good call to protect your peace and concentration."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm just doing laundry and catching up on some reading. Nothing special going on this weekend.", "output": "Sometimes a low-key weekend is exactly what is needed. Getting chores done and reading sounds like a balanced and productive way to spend your time."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I looked at the clock and realized I've been studying for four hours straight. Time flew by.", "output": "That is impressive focus! It is surprising how fast time goes when you are in the zone. Make sure to take a break now and stretch or grab a snack."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I'm really anxious about money. Textbooks were so expensive this semester and my bank account is getting low.", "output": "Financial stress is incredibly draining and very common for students. It is a heavy burden to carry. Maybe looking into campus resources or budgeting tips could help offer a little control, but for now, just breathe."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: It's raining and gray outside, and I just don't have the motivation to get out of bed or go to class.", "output": " gloomy weather can really affect your mood and motivation. Be gentle with yourself today. If you can manage small steps, that's great, but if you need a little rest, that is okay too."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I honestly don't know what to do anymore. I studied for two weeks straight for this calculus midterm and I still failed. It feels like no matter how hard I try, I'm just not smart enough for this major.", "output": "I can hear how discouraged you are feeling right now, and it makes total sense. Putting in that much effort and not getting the result you wanted is incredibly painful and frustrating. Please remember that one exam grade doesn't define your intelligence or your worthiness to be in this major. Maybe give yourself a day to just rest and process the disappointment before looking at next steps?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have a presentation tomorrow in my history class and I'm terrified. Every time I have to speak in front of people, my hands shake and I feel like I'm going to pass out. I just want to skip class to avoid it.", "output": "It sounds like your anxiety is really high right now, and that is a very common reaction to public speaking. The physical symptoms you described, like shaking hands, are your body's natural response to stress, even though they feel awful. It might help to practice just the first minute of your talk tonight so you feel a bit more grounded starting out. Whatever happens, you are brave for facing this."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My roommate left the kitchen a total mess again after I just cleaned it yesterday. I've asked them three times to clean up after themselves, and they just ignore me. It's so disrespectful.", "output": "That sounds incredibly frustrating and exhausting. It is completely valid to feel angry when your boundaries are ignored, especially in your own living space. It shows a lack of respect for your time and effort in keeping the place clean. When you're feeling a bit calmer, maybe you could suggest a roommate meeting to set firm ground rules?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: Everyone in my friend group is going out tonight, but nobody invited me. I saw them planning it in the group chat and just felt invisible. I guess I'm not as close to them as I thought.", "output": "I am so sorry you're going through this; feeling excluded is one of the loneliest feelings there is. It's heartbreaking to question your place in a friendship group like that. It’s okay to feel hurt and to spend tonight doing something kind for yourself, like watching a favorite movie. You deserve friends who make you feel included and valued."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: You won't believe it, but I actually got the internship I applied for! I was so sure I bombed the interview, but they just called to offer me the position starting next month.", "output": "That is absolutely amazing news! Congratulations on getting the internship! It’s such a great feeling when hard work pays off, especially when you were doubting yourself. You should definitely take some time to celebrate this victory today—you earned it!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I've just been going through the motions lately. Wake up, go to class, eat, sleep. Nothing is really wrong, but nothing feels exciting either. I just feel kind of blah.", "output": "It sounds like you're experiencing a bit of burnout or emotional fatigue. That feeling of just 'going through the motions' can actually be quite draining in its own way. It’s okay to have periods where life feels a bit gray. Sometimes shaking up your routine even a tiny bit, like taking a walk in a new place, can help spark a little feeling again."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I looked in the mirror today and just hated what I saw. My skin is breaking out and I feel like I've gained so much weight since starting college. I feel gross.", "output": "I'm so sorry you're struggling with your self-image today; those feelings can be so heavy and intrusive. It is really common to go through physical changes during college due to stress and lifestyle shifts, but that doesn't make it easier to accept. Try to be gentle with yourself today—your worth is not defined by your appearance or your skin."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: My parents called and said they need to talk to me about something serious this weekend. They wouldn't say what it is. My mind is racing thinking something terrible happened or they are getting divorced.", "output": "That vague 'we need to talk' message is incredibly anxiety-inducing. It is completely understandable that your mind is jumping to the worst-case scenarios right now. waiting is often the hardest part. Try to distract yourself with something comforting until you can speak with them, rather than letting the worry consume you."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I miss my dog so much. It's been three months since I moved into the dorms, and FaceTiming my parents just makes me cry because I can't pet him. I feel silly for being this upset over a pet.", "output": "Please don't feel silly; our pets are family and major sources of comfort, so missing them is completely natural. It’s really hard to transition to a new living situation without that constant companionship. It's okay to cry and let yourself miss him. Maybe keeping a framed photo of him on your desk could be a small comfort?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I just found out my ex is dating my lab partner. I literally dropped my phone when I saw the post. I didn't even know they knew each other.", "output": "Wow, that is a huge shock to process all at once. It makes total sense that you're feeling blindsided by that news, especially since you have to see your lab partner regularly. Take a deep breath; you don't have to figure out how to handle the situation right this second. Just give yourself a moment to recover from the surprise."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: The professor changed the requirements for the final project three days before it's due. I've already done half the work based on the old syllabus! It's so unfair.", "output": "That is incredibly unfair and disorganized on the professor's part. You have every right to be furious about your time and effort being wasted like that. It puts so much unnecessary pressure on you right at the deadline. Is it possible to email the professor or a TA to clarify if the work you've already done can still be used?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I think I might fail this semester. I'm so behind in three classes and I can't focus on anything. I'm scared I'm going to lose my scholarship.", "output": "That sounds like a very heavy weight to carry, and the fear of losing your scholarship is very real. When everything piles up like that, it’s easy to feel paralyzed. Remember that you don't have to solve everything today. Maybe just pick one small assignment to focus on for the next hour to break the paralysis?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: It's my birthday today and nobody here remembered. I know I'm new to the city, but spending my birthday alone in my apartment eating takeout is just really depressing.", "output": "Happy Birthday! I am so sorry that you are spending it feeling lonely; that is a really painful way to spend a special day. It’s okay to feel sad about the isolation, especially when you're in a new city. I hope you can do something nice for yourself tonight, even if it's just watching your favorite comfort show."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I saw some guys in the cafeteria making fun of a girl's stutter. It made me feel sick to my stomach that people can be so cruel. I wanted to say something but I froze.", "output": "It is heartbreaking and revolting to witness bullying like that. Your reaction of disgust shows that you have a kind and empathetic heart. Please don't beat yourself up for freezing; it's a very common reaction in shocking situations. The fact that you care this much says a lot about your character."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I finally finished writing my thesis! It took me six months of sleepless nights, but I just hit submit. I feel like a massive weight has been lifted off my shoulders.", "output": "That is a monumental achievement! Congratulations on finishing your thesis! The relief you are feeling must be incredible after six months of grinding. You should be incredibly proud of your dedication and perseverance. Make sure you get some well-deserved rest now!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I don't really know what to say. I'm just bored. Every day feels the same and I don't have any hobbies anymore. I used to like painting but now it feels like work.", "output": "It sounds like you've hit a bit of a plateau where things feel stagnant. Losing interest in hobbies you used to love, like painting, can be a sign that you need a break or a change of pace. You don't have to force yourself to create if it doesn't feel right. Maybe trying something completely low-effort, like listening to a new podcast, might help pass the time?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I broke up with my boyfriend last week and today is the first day I haven't cried, but I still feel empty. I see things that remind me of him everywhere on campus.", "output": "Breakups are incredibly difficult, and healing is not a straight line. It sounds like you are slowly moving through the grief, even if you still feel empty. Seeing reminders on campus is like touching a bruise, but eventually, those places will just become places again. Be patient with yourself; you are doing the best you can."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have to call the financial aid office because there's a hold on my account, but I have terrible phone anxiety. I've been staring at the number for an hour.", "output": "Phone anxiety is very real and can feel like a huge barrier, especially when the stakes are high like with financial aid. It makes sense that you're feeling frozen. Sometimes it helps to write down exactly what you want to say beforehand so you have a script. You can do this—just one dial, and the anticipation will be over."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My group project members are useless. They haven't replied to the chat in a week and the deadline is tomorrow. I'm going to end up doing all the work myself and they'll get the credit.", "output": "That is infuriating! Group projects can be a nightmare when the workload isn't shared equally. It is completely unjust that you are being forced to carry the team to save your own grade. Make sure you document your attempts to contact them; you might be able to show the professor that you did the work solo."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel like I'm drifting apart from my high school best friend. We used to talk every day, but now she leaves me on read for days. It feels like she's moved on and I'm stuck in the past.", "output": "Growing apart from a childhood friend is a specific kind of grief that really hurts. It’s painful to feel like you are valuing the connection more than the other person right now. Relationships do change as we grow, but that doesn't make the transition any less sad. It’s okay to mourn the closeness you used to have."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: My parents just told me they are selling my childhood home. I didn't see that coming at all. I thought I'd be able to go back there for breaks, but now everything is changing.", "output": "That is a huge change to process unexpectedly. Your childhood home holds so many memories, so it makes sense that you feel unmoored by this news. It can feel like a piece of your history is slipping away. Give yourself time to feel sad and nostalgic about it; it's a big loss."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I accidentally read a text on my boyfriend's phone that wasn't for me, and it was him talking trash about me to his friends. I feel so betrayed and grossed out.", "output": "That is a terrible violation of trust, and finding that out is gut-wrenching. Feeling 'grossed out' is a very natural reaction to realizing someone you love was speaking poorly of you behind your back. You deserve a partner who respects you both to your face and when you aren't around. Take some time to think about what you need to do for your own well-being."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I'm worried I picked the wrong major. Everyone else in my classes seems to get the material instantly, and I'm struggling to understand the basics. What if I'm wasting my tuition money?", "output": "Imposter syndrome is extremely common in college; so many students feel exactly like you do, even if they look confident on the outside. It's scary to think about the future and money, but struggling with new material doesn't mean you are on the wrong path. It might just mean you need a different explanation or a bit more time to grasp the concepts."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I went to the club fair today and actually signed up for the hiking club! I was nervous to go alone, but the people at the booth were super nice.", "output": "That is a fantastic step! It takes a lot of courage to put yourself out there and go to a fair alone. I'm so glad the people were welcoming. Joining a club is such a great way to meet people and get out of your routine. I hope you have an amazing time on your first hike!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel really homesick today. I saw a family eating dinner together at a restaurant and it just made me ache for my mom's cooking and hearing my dad's jokes.", "output": "Homesickness can hit you out of nowhere, often triggered by small things like that. It sounds like you have a wonderful family, which makes being away from them that much harder. It is okay to have days where you just want to be a kid at home again. maybe you can call them tonight just to hear their voices?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: I got a parking ticket on campus even though I have a permit! They said I was in the wrong zone, but the sign was totally covered by a bush. It's just a scam to get more money.", "output": "That sounds incredibly frustrating and unfair. Dealing with campus parking is stressful enough without getting fined for unclear signage. You have every right to be annoyed about losing money over something that wasn't your fault. You should definitely try to appeal the ticket and take a photo of the covered sign as proof."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I have a lot of homework to do, but I'm just lying in bed scrolling on my phone. I know I should get up, but I can't find the motivation.", "output": "It sounds like you're stuck in a bit of a procrastination loop. That 'doom scrolling' paralysis happens to the best of us. Sometimes the task feels too big, so we avoid it entirely. Maybe try setting a timer for just 5 minutes of work? Often, starting is the hardest part."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I'm walking home alone in the dark and I feel like someone is following me.", "output": "Please get to a safe, public place immediately or call someone. Your safety is paramount. Trust your gut instinct; it is better to be 'wrong' and safe than polite and in danger. Stay on the phone with someone until you are inside your door."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: My laptop crashed and I lost the essay I was writing. I thought autosave was on, but it wasn't. I just want to cry. I don't have the energy to rewrite it.", "output": "Oh no, that is absolutely devastating. Losing work is a student's worst nightmare, and the feeling of defeat is overwhelming. It is perfectly okay to cry and feel frustrated right now. Don't try to rewrite it immediately while you're this upset. Take a break, breathe, and come back to it when the shock has worn off."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: My roommate and I finally stopped arguing and had a movie night. It felt like how it used to be. I'm really glad we're talking again.", "output": "I'm so happy to hear that! repairing a relationship with someone you live with brings such a sense of relief and peace. It sounds like a lovely evening and a great step forward for your friendship. Enjoy this peaceful vibe!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I studied so hard for my chemistry midterm, but I still ended up failing. I feel like I'm just not smart enough for this major.", "output": "I hear how disappointed and discouraged you are right now. Putting in that much effort and not seeing the results you wanted is incredibly tough. One test doesn't define your intelligence or your future in this major; please try to be gentle with yourself today."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have a presentation tomorrow in front of the whole class, and I'm terrified. My hands start shaking just thinking about it.", "output": "It is completely understandable to feel nervous about public speaking; so many people feel the exact same way. That physical reaction is just your body's way of saying this matters to you. Try to take some slow, deep breaths, and remember that you are prepared and capable."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My roommate borrowed my favorite sweater without asking and spilled coffee on it. She didn't even apologize! I'm so mad I can't even look at her.", "output": "That sounds incredibly frustrating and disrespectful of your personal boundaries. It makes sense that you are angry, especially since she didn't acknowledge the mistake or apologize. When you feel ready, it might help to have a calm conversation about how her actions affected you."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I finally got the internship I applied for! I've been waiting two weeks for the email, and I literally screamed when I saw it.", "output": "That is absolutely amazing news! Congratulations on getting the internship; the waiting must have been so stressful, but it paid off. I am so happy for you, and you should definitely take some time to celebrate this achievement!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I went to the dining hall and found a hair in my soup. It was so gross, I immediately lost my appetite and left.", "output": "Ugh, that is a really unpleasant experience; I completely get why you lost your appetite. Finding something like that is definitely off-putting. Hopefully, your next meal will be much more enjoyable and hygienic."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I've just been sitting in the library for five hours. I'm not really stressed, just kind of bored and tired of looking at this screen.", "output": "It sounds like you have hit a bit of a wall after being focused for so long. Five hours is a long time to stare at a screen. Maybe taking a short walk or grabbing a snack could help you reset and get some energy back."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: My best friend and I are drifting apart since we went to different colleges. She barely answers my texts anymore, and I miss her so much.", "output": "It is heartbreaking to feel that distance growing with someone who means so much to you. Transitions like college can shift dynamics, but it doesn't erase the bond you share. It's okay to grieve the way things used to be while you figure out this new phase of your friendship."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I don't know if I'm going to be able to afford rent next semester. My hours got cut at work and I'm panicking about money.", "output": "Financial uncertainty is incredibly stressful and scary to deal with. It makes total sense that you are feeling panicked given the sudden change in your work hours. Have you looked into any student financial aid resources or emergency funds that your university might offer?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I baked a cake for my mom's birthday and it didn't sink in the middle! It actually looks professional.", "output": "That is a baking victory! Cakes can be so temperamental, so getting a perfect rise is a great surprise. Your mom is going to be so impressed that you made something so beautiful for her. It makes the celebration even more special."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel so lonely here. Everyone else seems to have their friend groups already, and I'm just spending Friday night alone in my room again.", "output": "Loneliness can be such a heavy feeling, especially when it seems like everyone else is connected. Please know that what you see on the surface doesn't always reflect reality; many people are still finding their footing. You are worthy of connection, and it takes time to find your people."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My group project partner hasn't done a single thing, and the deadline is tomorrow. I'm going to have to do all the work myself if I want a good grade.", "output": "It is completely unfair that you are being put in that position. Feeling angry about carrying the weight of a group project is totally valid. Make sure to document what you've done, and try to focus on getting through tomorrow so you can put this stress behind you."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I think I might have chosen the wrong career path. Everyone says this field is dying, and I'm scared I'm wasting my time and money.", "output": "Questioning your path is a very scary and confusing place to be. It is natural to worry about your future when you hear negative things about your field. Remember that skills are often transferable, and it is okay to explore and pivot as you learn more about what you want."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgusted\nUser: The way some people talk about others behind their backs in my sorority is vile. It makes me sick to listen to the gossip.", "output": "It sounds like that environment is really clashing with your values right now. Dealing with constant toxicity and gossip is draining and honestly pretty repulsive. It speaks well of your character that you find that behavior unacceptable."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I finally finished my thesis! I hit submit five minutes ago. I feel lighter than air.", "output": "That is a huge milestone! The relief you are feeling must be immense after carrying that workload for so long. You worked hard for this moment, so please enjoy that 'lighter than air' feeling—you earned it!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm just trying to decide what classes to take next semester. It's not urgent, but I'm looking through the catalog.", "output": "Planning ahead is a great way to feel prepared for the upcoming term. It can actually be kind of interesting to see what's available without the pressure of immediate deadlines. I hope you find some courses that genuinely spark your interest."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I miss my dog so much. My parents sent me a picture of him sleeping on my bed, and I just started crying.", "output": "Being away from a beloved pet is so much harder than people realize. They are family, and seeing him in your space must have brought all those feelings to the surface. It's okay to cry and miss him; it just shows how much you love him."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have a meeting with my advisor to discuss my failing grades. I feel sick to my stomach. What if they kick me out?", "output": "The anticipation of a meeting like that is often the hardest part. It is terrifying to feel like your standing at the school is at risk. Try to remember that advisors are generally there to help you find a solution, not just to punish you."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My parents are constantly comparing me to my older brother. I'm tired of hearing about how successful he is. I'm my own person!", "output": "That sounds incredibly hurtful and frustrating. You deserve to be recognized for your own unique strengths and path, not measured against someone else. It is completely valid to want your parents to see and appreciate you for who you are."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: My long-distance boyfriend surprised me with a visit this weekend! I'm so excited I can't focus on anything else.", "output": "That is the sweetest surprise! Long-distance relationships are tough, so getting unexpected time together is incredibly special. Enjoy every moment of your weekend together; focus can wait until Monday!"}

I go to class, I eat, I sleep, but I don't feel passionate about anything.", "output": "Feeling aimless or disconnected from your passion is a heavy and lonely experience.

{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: Just doing laundry. It's piling up, so I guess I have to spend the afternoon in the basement.", "output": "Laundry is one of those chores that is never fun, but always necessary.

I thought we were close, but I guess I was wrong.", "output": "That is such a painful realization to come to.

It is frustrating when those in charge don't seem to respect your time or stress levels."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I saw a cockroach in my kitchen this morning. I feel like my skin is crawling.", "output": "That is the worst way to start the morning.

I hope you can get some traps or pest control in there so you can feel comfortable in your own kitchen again."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: My laptop is making a weird noise and acting slow. If it crashes, I lose all my notes. I can't afford a new one.", "output": "That is a terrifying situation, especially with all your work on the line. The fear of losing your data and the financial stress combined is overwhelming. If you can, try to back up your files to a cloud service immediately just to be safe."}

Everyone here looks like a model, and I just feel awkward and ugly.", "output": "Body image struggles are so painful and can really weigh on your self-esteem.

{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I ran into my high school math teacher at the coffee shop on campus. It was so random seeing him here!", "output": "That is such a coincidence! Running into someone from your past in a completely different context can be really disorienting but also kind of fun. It must have been a funny moment of worlds colliding."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: A stranger paid for my coffee this morning because I forgot my wallet. It restored my faith in humanity.", "output": "That is such a lovely, heartwarming gesture! It is amazing how a small act of kindness from a stranger can turn a stressful moment into a great one. I'm so glad you experienced that generosity today."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I just feel really overwhelmed with my classes right now. It feels like everyone else is handling the workload fine, but I'm barely keeping my head above water.", "output": "I hear how heavy that weight feels, and it makes total sense that you’re feeling overwhelmed. It is really tough when it seems like others are breezing through while you are struggling, but remember that we often don't see the battles others are fighting privately. Your feelings are valid, and you are doing the best you can. Have you been able to take any small breaks to just breathe today? Sometimes stepping away for even five minutes can help reset things a little bit."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have a presentation tomorrow and I'm terrified. I hate public speaking and I'm convinced I'm going to freeze up and embarrass myself in front of the whole class.", "output": "That sounds incredibly nerve-wracking, and it is completely normal to feel scared about public speaking. The fear of freezing up is a very common anxiety, even for people who look confident. Try to be gentle with yourself tonight and remember that your classmates are likely worried about their own turns, not judging you. You have prepared for this, and even if you stumble, it doesn't define your worth. Is there a comforting routine you can do tonight to help you relax before bed?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My roommate ate my leftovers again without asking! I was saving that for lunch because I have no time to cook today. It's so disrespectful.", "output": "That is so frustrating! It is completely understandable that you are angry—having your boundaries crossed like that, especially when you’re busy, feels really unfair. Food is often the highlight of a busy day, and losing that lunch adds unnecessary stress. Have you had a chance to talk to them about how this impacts your schedule? You deserve to have your space and property respected."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm just making a cup of tea and watching the birds outside. A quiet afternoon.", "output": "That sounds like a lovely, peaceful interlude. There is something very grounding about hot tea and nature watching. It is a nice way to recharge your batteries before getting back to the busyness of life. Enjoy the quiet."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: Someone hit my car in the parking lot and didn't leave a note. There's a huge dent!", "output": "That is a cowardly and criminal.

You have every right to be absolutely livid about their dishonesty."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I walked into the communal kitchen and it smelled terrible. People just leave their dishes rotting in the sink for days. It's so gross.", "output": "Ugh, that sounds incredibly unpleasant. It is really hard to feel comfortable in your own home when shared spaces aren't taken care of. Your disgust is totally valid; hygiene and respect for shared areas are important.

I know she's busy, but I can't help feeling like she's ignoring me or that I did something wrong.", "output": "It is really painful to feel that silence from someone you care about. Even when logic tells us they are busy, our hearts often worry about rejection or conflict. It shows how much you value the friendship that you noticed the absence so quickly. Try to distract yourself with something you enjoy while you wait. You are a good friend, and hopefully, she will reach out soon to explain."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I actually got an A on my history paper. I didn't think the professor liked my writing style at all.", "output": "What a wonderful surprise!

It just goes to show that your hard work is translating, even when you doubt it. Enjoy this confidence boost!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: My parents are arguing a lot lately. I can hear them shouting downstairs and I'm scared they're going to get a divorce.", "output": "I am so sorry you are going through this; that sounds incredibly stressful and scary. Feeling unstable in your own home is a heavy burden to carry. It is not your job to fix their relationship, but it makes sense that you are worried about the future. Is there a safe, quiet place you can go, like a library or a friend's house, when things get too loud? Please take care of your own heart right now."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel really lonely. I'm surrounded by people at university, but I don't feel like I really connect with anyone deeply.", "output": "That is a very profound and difficult kind of loneliness—being alone in a crowd.

Just focus on getting there safely now."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I tried to talk to my group partner about the project, and he made a really inappropriate joke. It made my skin crawl.", "output": "I am so sorry that happened to you. That sounds extremely uncomfortable and unprofessional. Your reaction of disgust is a natural protective response to having a boundary crossed. You shouldn't have to deal with that kind of behavior while just trying to do your work. If you feel safe doing so, you might want to talk to your professor, but regardless, know that your feelings are completely justified."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: My dog was so happy to see me when I went home for the weekend. It made me feel so loved.", "output": "That sounds absolutely heartwarming! There is nothing quite like the unconditional love of a pet to lift your spirits. It is wonderful that you got to recharge with some puppy love. Hold onto that warm feeling as you go about your week. You are definitely loved!"}

The butterflies of a new potential romance are the best feeling. It is totally okay to freak out internally while playing it cool on the outside. Enjoy the anticipation and have a great time hanging out!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have to choose a major soon and I have no idea what I want to do. I'm scared I'll pick the wrong thing and ruin my life.", "output": "That is a huge decision, and the pressure to get it 'right' feels immense. Please remember that very few choices in life are permanent or ruinous. Many people change paths multiple times, and that is part of the journey. It is okay not to have it all figured out yet. Trust that you will find your way, one step at a time."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I missed my little sister's birthday because of exams. I feel like a terrible sibling.", "output": "Oh, that is a really tough situation. The guilt you are feeling shows how much you love and care about your sister. You are not a terrible sibling; you are a student under a lot of pressure. Maybe you can plan a special 'late birthday' celebration just for the two of you when you are free? She likely understands more than you think."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: I put so much effort into helping my friend move, and he didn't even say thank you. He just expected it.", "output": "That really stings. It is very hurtful when our generosity is taken for granted. You have every right to feel angry about being undervalued. Friendship should be a two-way street of appreciation. It might be worth waiting until you're less angry and then letting him know how that made you feel. Your time and effort are valuable."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I miss my grandma. She passed away last year and today would have been her birthday.", "output": "Birthdays and anniversaries are always hard after a loss; they bring the grief right back to the surface.

{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I think I might have accidentally offended my boss at my part-time job. She looked really stern when I left.", "output": "It is so easy to replay moments in our heads and spiral into worry. That uncertainty can be really scary, especially when it involves work. Try not to jump to the worst-case scenario just yet; she might have just been having a bad day herself. If it still bothers you next shift, a simple check-in might clear the air. For now, try to be kind to yourself."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: Everyone is going to the concert tonight except me because I can't afford a ticket. FOMO is hitting hard.", "output": "Missing out because of money is a really crummy feeling. It is totally valid to feel sad and left out while watching everyone else make plans.

You are not alone in having to skip things, even if it feels like it right now."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I cooked a meal from scratch for the first time and it actually tasted good!", "output": "That is a fantastic achievement!

Do you think you'll try making it again?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have to travel by plane tomorrow and I'm terrified of flying. Every bump makes me panic.", "output": "Flight anxiety is very real and can be overwhelming. The lack of control is what makes it so scary. Try to focus on the fact that thousands of flights land safely every single day.

{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I found a box of old photos in the attic. I forgot I even had these!", "output": "That is like finding a time capsule! It is always a surprise to see old versions of yourself and your family. Going through them must be a journey down memory lane. I bet there are some funny fashion choices in there too!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: My laptop is making a weird noise and I haven't backed up my final paper. I'm panic-stricken.", "output": "That is a terrifying situation! Technology issues always happen at the worst times. Take a deep breath and try to back up your file immediately to a cloud service or email it to yourself if you can. Once that is safe, you can deal with the computer issues. You caught it now, which is the important thing!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I don't like how I look in the mirror today. I feel like I've gained weight and nothing fits right.", "output": "I am sorry you are having a tough body image day. Those days can be really draining and make us feel so critical of ourselves.

Maybe wear something that feels physically comfortable today and be gentle with yourself."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: The administration lost my paperwork again! I have to resubmit everything. It's such a waste of my time.", "output": "That is incredibly frustrating!

I hope the rest of your day is just as sweet!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: My roommate left a half-eaten yogurt on the counter for three days. It's growing mold.", "output": "That is a biohazard! It is so disrespectful to leave rotting food in a shared space. The visual and the smell are just gross. You shouldn't have to parent your roommate. I hope they clean it up immediately when you point it out."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have a dentist appointment tomorrow and I know I need a filling. I hate the drill sound.", "output": "Dental anxiety is very real and very common. The sounds and sensations can be really overwhelming. It is okay to feel scared about it. Maybe you can bring headphones and listen to your favorite music or a podcast to drown out the noise? You are taking care of your health, which is brave, even if it's scary."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm just waiting for my laundry to finish. It's taking forever.", "output": "The laundry waiting game is a universal student experience!

Hang in there, the timer will buzz eventually!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel so overwhelmed with my finals coming up. I don't think I can learn it all in time, and I'm scared of failing.", "output": "It is completely understandable to feel overwhelmed during finals week; that is a very heavy weight to carry. It sounds like you are putting a lot of pressure on yourself to be perfect. Remember that your worth is not defined by a single exam or grade.

You have handled difficulties before, and you can get through this too."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm organizing my bookshelf by color. It's strangely satisfying.", "output": "The rainbow bookshelf aesthetic!

I bet your room will look much brighter when you are done."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: My roommate and I got into a huge fight, and now the atmosphere in the dorm is icy. I'm worried we won't be friends anymore.", "output": "Living in a tense environment can be incredibly stressful, especially when it involves a friend. It makes sense that you feel anxious about the future of your friendship and your living situation. Conflict is really hard, but it doesn't always mean the end of a relationship.

{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My professor gave me a C on a paper I worked on for weeks. It feels so unfair because I followed all the instructions perfectly.", "output": "It is incredibly frustrating to feel like your hard work hasn't been recognized or rewarded fairly. It sounds like you put a lot of effort into that paper, so seeing that grade must be really disappointing. Your feelings of anger are valid given how much you cared about the assignment. Once the initial heat fades, it might help to ask for feedback to understand the grading, but for now, it is okay to just be upset. You are clearly a dedicated student, and one grade doesn't change that."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: The cafeteria food was absolutely gross today. I found a hair in my soup and I literally lost my appetite immediately.", "output": "That sounds like a really unpleasant experience; finding something like that in your food is definitely stomach-turning. It is totally natural to lose your appetite after seeing that. I hope you were able to find something else to eat or can grab a snack later so you don't go hungry. Maybe treat yourself to a meal you actually enjoy later to make up for it. You definitely deserve a better lunch than that!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: Just finished classes for the day. I have some homework to do later, but right now I'm just sitting around.", "output": "It sounds like you have a nice little pocket of downtime between your classes and your homework. It is good to have those quiet moments to just decompress and do nothing for a bit. Maybe you can use this time to listen to some music or just rest your eyes.

{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I've been feeling really lonely lately. Everyone seems to have their own group of friends except me.", "output": "Loneliness is such a heavy and painful feeling, and it is really hard when it seems like everyone else is connected. Please know that what you are seeing on the outside doesn't always reflect how others are truly feeling. It takes time to find your people, and it is okay that you haven't found your group yet. You are worthy of connection and friendship, even if it feels out of reach right now. Be gentle with yourself while you navigate this season."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: I've been working on this group project alone while everyone else slacks off. I'm so done.", "output": "That is the classic group project nightmare. It is incredibly unfair that you are carrying the weight for everyone else. You are doing the work of four people and getting the credit of one.

It's the first time I've been away from him for this long.", "output": "It is so hard to be away from a beloved pet; they really are family members. The bond you have with your dog sounds very special, and the distance must be painful. It is completely normal to feel this homesickness for your furry friend. Maybe looking at photos or videos of him could bring a little comfort right now. He is surely missing you just as much and will be so happy when you reunite."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My lab partner didn't do any of their part of the project, and now I have to do it all tonight or we both fail.", "output": "That is an incredibly unfair position to be put in, and you have every right to be angry. It is exhausting to have to pick up the slack for someone else, especially under a deadline. Feeling taken advantage of in a group project is a classic but very real frustration. Focus on getting through tonight for your own sake, but remember that your frustration is justified. Make sure to get some rest once this is finally turned in."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: My roommate leaves their dirty dishes in the sink for days. The smell is getting unbearable and I'm sick of it.", "output": "Living in a messy environment that you can't control is really difficult and frustrating. It is totally understandable that the smell and the mess are disgusting to you. You deserve to feel comfortable and clean in your own living space. It sounds like this has been building up for a while, which makes it even harder to deal with. I hope you can find a moment to talk to them or find a way to get some fresh air."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I just had the best coffee date with a new friend. We talked for hours and realized we have so much in common.", "output": "That sounds like such a refreshing and joyful experience!

My part-time job cut my hours and I don't know if I can make rent next month.", "output": "Financial uncertainty is incredibly stressful and scary. It makes complete sense that you are feeling anxious about meeting your basic needs like rent. It sounds like a very heavy burden to carry on top of being a student. Please remember that this situation is not a reflection of your worth or hard work. There might be resources on campus or locally that can offer temporary support, so you don't have to face this alone."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I tried to join a club today but I felt so awkward and out of place. I just left early and cried in the bathroom.", "output": "I am so sorry you had such a painful experience trying to put yourself out there. It takes a lot of courage to show up to a new place, and it is heartbreaking when it doesn't go well. Feeling awkward and out of place is a universal feeling, though it feels uniquely isolating in the moment. It is okay to cry and release that tension; you were brave for trying. Give yourself some kindness today; one difficult evening doesn't mean you don't belong."}

{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I think I chose the wrong major. Everyone else seems to get the material instantly, but I'm struggling to understand the basics.", "output": "It is very common to question your path, especially when things feel difficult. Comparing your internal struggle to others' external appearances can be really scary and misleading. Just because you are struggling now doesn't mean you are in the wrong place or that you can't succeed. Learning curves look different for everyone. Be patient with yourself as you navigate these doubts; you are figuring things out at your own pace."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: I can't believe the bus skipped my stop again! Now I'm going to be late for my shift and my boss is going to kill me.", "output": "That is incredibly frustrating! It is awful when things outside of your control mess up your schedule and cause you stress. It makes total sense that you are angry about the unreliability of the bus.

{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I walked into the bathroom and someone had left a huge mess everywhere. People are so disrespectful.", "output": "That is really gross and disrespectful. It is baffling how some people can be so inconsiderate of shared spaces. Your feeling of disgust is completely justified; nobody wants to deal with that. It really dampens your day to encounter such a lack of basic manners. I hope you can find a cleaner restroom to use and shake off that unpleasantness."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel like I'm drifting apart from my high school friends. We used to talk every day, but now nobody replies to the group chat.", "output": "Growing apart from old friends is a distinct and aching kind of sadness. It is really hard to watch those close connections fade, especially when you still value them. The silence in the group chat must feel very lonely. This happens often during transitions like college, but it doesn't make it hurt less. Cherish the memories you have, and know that friendships often ebb and flow over time."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprise\nUser: I just found out my favorite band is playing on campus next week! I had no idea they were touring.", "output": "What an amazing surprise!

I hope you are able to get tickets and go enjoy the show. Moments like that can really be the highlight of the semester!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I'm worried I'm not making the most of my college years. I feel like time is slipping away and I haven't done enough.", "output": "That fear of 'missing out' or wasting time is something many students wrestle with. It sounds like you are putting a lot of pressure on yourself to have a 'perfect' experience. Remember that there is no single right way to do college, and rest is just as important as activity. You are doing enough just by being here and navigating life. Try to be present in the now rather than worrying about the timeline."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel really lonely in this new city. I haven't made any real friends yet.", "output": "Moving to a new city is one of the loneliest things you can do at first. It takes time to build a tribe, and the in-between period is really hard. Please be patient with yourself; you aren't doing anything wrong. It just takes time. You will find your people eventually."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have a job interview in an hour. My palms are sweating and my heart is racing.", "output": "That pre-interview anxiety is a sign that you care about the opportunity. Your body is ramping up energy to help you perform. Try to channel that nervous energy into enthusiasm. You have prepared for this, and they asked to interview you because they are already interested. You've got this."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I just feel really burnt out. I'm tired all the time and nothing sounds fun anymore.", "output": "Burnout is a very real and exhausting state to be in. It sounds like your mind and body are asking for a break. Feeling like the joy has been sucked out of things is a heavy and sad experience. Please try to listen to your body's need for rest without judgment. You don't have to be productive all the time; sometimes just existing is enough. Be gentle with yourself while you recover your energy."}

It's so creepy.", "output": "That sounds like a really uncomfortable and safe environment to be in. It is completely valid to feel disgusted by that kind of behavior. You shouldn't have to deal with creepiness while trying to learn. It is reassuring that others feel the same way, so you aren't imagining it. I hope the situation improves or that he stops, because you deserve a respectful classroom."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel like I'm drowning in coursework. Every time I finish one assignment, three more appear. I just want to sleep for a week.", "output": "I hear how overwhelmed you're feeling, and it makes total sense that you'd want a break when things feel this heavy. Academic pressure can be relentless. Remember to take small pauses just to breathe; you're doing your best, and that is enough."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have a presentation tomorrow and I'm terrified. My hands shake whenever I have to speak in front of people. I think I'm going to mess it up.", "output": "It's completely normal to feel that rush of anxiety before a presentation. Many people feel the same way, even if they don't show it. Try to be gentle with yourself and focus on taking it one sentence at a time. You've prepared for this, and you can get through it."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My roommate ate my leftovers again without asking. It's so disrespectful! I've told them a million times to just ask me first.", "output": "That sounds incredibly frustrating. It's really important to have your boundaries respected, especially in your own home. It makes sense that you're angry when you've been clear about what you need."}

You deserve friends who include you and make you feel valued."}

It is such a creepy, invasive feeling to have sticky web on your face. And the fear that the spider is on you is real! Brush it off and shake it out; you'll feel clean again in a minute."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: The cafeteria food was absolutely gross today. It smelled weird and looked undercooked. I lost my appetite completely.", "output": "Ugh, that sounds really unpleasant. There's nothing worse than looking forward to a meal and being totally put off by it. I hope you can find something better to eat later!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm just sitting here watching the rain. It's pretty quiet in the dorm today. Not much going on.", "output": "Sounds like a peaceful moment. Sometimes it's nice to just have a quiet day to recharge and watch the world go by. Enjoy the downtime."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm just brewing some coffee. The smell is filling the kitchen.", "output": "The smell of fresh coffee is one of the best scents in the world.

I was sure I lost it because my GPA dropped a little last semester.", "output": "Wow, what a wonderful surprise! That must be such a huge relief for you.

Every time they call, I worry they're going to tell me they're getting divorced.", "output": "Carrying that worry around must be so heavy for you.

I wish I looked like the people on Instagram.", "output": "I'm sorry you're having a tough body image day; those feelings can be really stinging.

Hopefully, you can get the bedding changed and everything cleaned up so you can feel comfortable again soon."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My friend cancelled our plans at the last minute again. She always does this.", "output": "That is so disrespectful of your time.

College is okay, but I haven't found anyone I click with like I did with them.", "output": "Transitions are really hard, and missing those deep, established connections is completely normal.

{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: The bus skipped my stop again! Now I'm going to be late for my shift and my manager is going to yell at me.", "output": "That is so exasperating! It's incredibly stressful when things outside your control mess up your schedule. I hope your manager is understanding given the situation."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: Someone in the library is eating tuna salad and talking loudly on their phone. It's so rude.", "output": "That sounds incredibly distracting and unpleasant. The library is supposed to be a sanctuary! It's totally valid to be annoyed by that lack of consideration."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I just baked cookies for the first time and they didn't burn! They actually taste really good.", "output": "Yay for a baking success! There's nothing quite like the smell of fresh cookies you made yourself. I hope you enjoy every bite!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I finally learned to parallel park! I did it perfectly on the first try today.", "output": "That is a huge driving milestone! Parallel parking is the nemesis of many drivers, so mastering it is a real skill. Doing it perfectly on the first try is impressive! You are going to be so much more confident driving in the city now."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have to go to the dentist today to get a cavity filled. I hate needles and drills.", "output": "Dental anxiety is super common, and it's tough to face those fears. Just remember it will be over relatively quickly, and you're taking good care of your health. You've got this!"}

Nature has a way of surprising us in the middle of ordinary days. That must have been a lovely moment to witness."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I didn't get into my dream grad school. I feel like my whole future is ruined.", "output": "I am so sorry. That rejection stings deeply, especially when you had your heart set on a specific path. It feels like a door slamming shut. Please give yourself time to grieve the plan you had, but remember that there are many paths to a happy future. This isn't the end, just a detour."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My group project partner didn't do any of their slides. I had to stay up until 3 AM finishing their part so we wouldn't fail.", "output": "That is completely unfair to you. You shouldn't have to carry the weight of the whole team. It's really angering when others don't pull their weight and it impacts your well-being."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I found a lump on my neck. I'm scared it's something bad. I'm afraid to even go to the doctor.", "output": "Health scares are terrifying, and your fear is a very natural reaction. While I can't give medical advice, getting it checked out is the bravest and best thing you can do for yourself. Hopefully, it turns out to be nothing serious."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: My ex texted me asking for money. After everything they put me through? The audacity is unreal.", "output": "Wow, that really is audacious.

{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel like I'm failing all my classes. I study so hard, but the grades just aren't reflecting my effort. It makes me want to give up entirely.", "output": "I hear how discouraging this is for you, especially when you're putting in so much effort. It’s incredibly tough to work hard and not see the results you want right away. Please remember that grades don't define your worth or your intelligence. Maybe taking a small break to recharge could help clear your mind before tackling the material again. You're doing your best, and that truly counts."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have a presentation tomorrow and I'm terrified. I hate public speaking. My hands shake and I feel like I'm going to pass out just thinking about it.", "output": "That sounds really scary, and it makes sense that you're feeling this way; public speaking is a huge fear for so many people. It's okay to feel nervous. Try to focus on your breathing if the anxiety starts to spike. No matter what happens, the presentation will be over soon, and you will get through it. I'm cheering for you."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My roommate ate my leftovers again! I specifically labeled them with my name. It's so disrespectful and I'm sick of having this conversation.", "output": "It is completely understandable that you are frustrated; having your boundaries ignored like that is really annoying. It’s not just about the food, but the lack of respect for your property. You have every right to be upset about this. Maybe when you're feeling a bit calmer, you can have a firm chat about boundaries, but for now, it's okay to just be mad."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I finally got the internship I applied for! I've been waiting to hear back for weeks and I was so sure I didn't get it.", "output": "That is absolutely amazing news! A massive congratulations to you!

{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: My best friend and I are drifting apart. We used to talk every day, but now she barely replies to my texts. I feel like I did something wrong.", "output": "It hurts so much to feel a distance growing in a close friendship. It’s natural to wonder if it's your fault, but often people just get busy or overwhelmed with their own lives. It doesn't necessarily mean she cares any less about you. Send yourself some kindness today; navigating changing friendships is really heavy on the heart."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I'm graduating soon and I have no idea what I want to do. Everyone else seems to have a plan, and I'm just lost. What if I fail at life?", "output": "The uncertainty of the future can be overwhelming, and feeling lost is a very common experience, even if others look like they have it all together. You don't need to have the next fifty years mapped out right now. It is okay to take small steps and explore different paths at your own pace. You aren't failing; you are just beginning a new chapter."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I saw someone being really rude to a waiter today. It made me feel sick. I don't understand how people can be so entitled.", "output": "Witnessing unkindness can be really jarring and upsetting. It speaks volumes about your character that you found that behavior unacceptable. It’s hard to wrap our heads around why people act that way sometimes. Hold onto that empathy you have; it’s a wonderful trait to possess in a world that sometimes lacks it."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I just feel really lonely lately. I'm surrounded by people at school, but I don't feel connected to anyone. It's like I'm invisible.", "output": "That is a very profound and painful kind of loneliness, feeling alone even in a crowd. It sounds incredibly isolating to feel unseen by those around you. Please know that your presence matters, even if it doesn't feel like it right now. Sometimes it takes a little time to find the people who truly resonate with us."}

Now I have to pack to go home.", "output": "It must be a huge relief to have that weight off your shoulders, regardless of the outcome. Crossing the finish line is an achievement in itself. Good luck with the packing; hopefully, you can get some well-deserved rest once you're settled at home. Take it easy."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My parents are constantly nagging me about my career choices. They want me to be a doctor, but I want to be an artist. They just won't listen!", "output": "That sounds incredibly frustrating and stifling. It is so hard when the people who should support you aren't hearing what you truly want. Your dreams and passions are valid, even if they don't align with their expectations. It takes a lot of courage to stand up for your own path."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I think I might have said something embarrassing in the group chat. No one has replied for an hour. I'm panicking that they all hate me.", "output": "The silence after sending a message can definitely trigger that anxiety loop. It’s easy to assume the worst, but often people are just busy or haven't checked their phones. Try to be gentle with yourself; one comment rarely changes how friends feel about you. Distracting yourself with a small activity might help ease the panic while you wait."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I actually passed my math test! I was convinced I failed. I didn't study as much as I should have, so this is a shock.", "output": "Wow, what a pleasant surprise! It must be such a relief to see that passing grade when you were expecting the opposite. Sometimes we underestimate how much we've actually retained. Take this as a nice little victory and maybe a confidence booster for next time!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have to give a toast at my sister's wedding. I hate being the center of attention.", "output": "Public speaking is terrifying for most people, especially at such an emotional event. It is normal to want to hide. Just speak from the heart; people are there to celebrate, not to judge your performance. Keep it short and sweet, and it will be over before you know it."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: The cafeteria food was absolutely revolting today. It smelled like old socks. I literally lost my appetite just walking in.", "output": "That sounds deeply unpleasant! Smell is such a strong trigger, so it's no wonder you lost your appetite. Hopefully, you can find something much tastier and fresher to eat elsewhere. You definitely deserve a meal that doesn't offend your senses!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: My long-distance boyfriend is coming to visit this weekend! I haven't seen him in three months. I'm so excited I can't focus on anything.", "output": "That is so wonderful! The anticipation of reuniting after so long is such a giddy, happy feeling. It makes total sense that you're distracted; you have something amazing to look forward to. I hope you both have the most fantastic time catching up and making memories!"}

I don't know how I'm going to make ends meet.", "output": "Financial stress is incredibly draining and scary. It feels like a heavy cloud hanging over everything when you aren't sure about the basics. You are resilient, and you're doing what you can in a tough situation. Taking it one step at a time is all anyone can ask of you right now."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I found a 4-leaf clover in the grass! I've never found one before.", "output": "That is so lucky! People spend hours looking for those and never find one. It feels like a little wink from the universe. Maybe you should go buy a lottery ticket while your luck is hot!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: The milk I poured into my cereal was sour. It ruined my whole breakfast.", "output": "That is a morning tragedy. The taste of sour milk is so distinct and awful. It really does ruin the whole bowl and your appetite. I hope you can find something else to eat to get that taste out of your mouth!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm just sitting here listening to rain. Not doing much. It's kind of a slow day.", "output": "That sounds like a peaceful way to spend the time. Sometimes slow days are exactly what we need to reset. Enjoy the sound of the rain and the downtime; it’s okay to just 'be' without doing anything productive for a while."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I miss my home. College is okay, but I miss my bed and my mom's cooking. I just feel really homesick right now.", "output": "Homesickness is such a real and tender ache. It’s okay to miss the comfort and familiarity of home, especially the little things like a home-cooked meal. It shows how much love you have for your family. Maybe giving them a quick call could help soothe your heart a little bit tonight."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: There's a rumor going around about me that isn't true. I'm scared everyone is going to believe it and judge me.", "output": "That sounds like a nightmare scenario, and it’s understandable that you’re feeling scared. It feels awful to have your reputation threatened by something false. The people who truly know you and care about you will trust your character over a rumor. Hang in there; often these things blow over faster than we expect."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I cooked a meal for myself for the first time and it didn't burn! It actually tasted pretty good. I'm proud of myself.", "output": "That is a great achievement! Cooking is a skill, and nailing a meal for the first time is definitely something to be proud of. It feels good to be self-sufficient and create something tasty. Here’s to many more delicious meals in your future!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel like I'm not good enough for my partner. They are so smart and successful, and I'm just... me. I feel like a burden.", "output": "It sounds like your insecurities are really loud right now, and that is a painful place to be. Please remember that relationships are about connection, not a resume comparison. Your partner is with you because they care about who you are, not just what you achieve. You bring your own unique value to the relationship."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: I missed the bus by one minute because I overslept. Now I'm going to be late for work and my boss is going to kill me. I'm so mad at myself.", "output": "That is one of the most frustrating ways to start the day. It’s so easy to beat yourself up, but honestly, it happens to the best of us. Try to take a deep breath; being late once doesn't undo all your hard work. Hopefully, your boss will be understanding, but for now, just focus on getting there safely."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have to go to the dentist today to get a cavity filled. I'm dreading the needle. I hate pain.", "output": "Dental anxiety is very real and very common, so you are not alone in feeling this way. The anticipation is often the hardest part. You are being brave by taking care of your health despite the fear. Treat yourself to something nice afterwards as a reward for getting through it!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm just sitting on the porch watching the sunset. The colors are nice today.", "output": "That sounds like a perfect way to end the day. Taking a moment to appreciate the beauty of the sky is very grounding. It puts the day's stress into perspective. Enjoy the show."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: My professor complimented my essay in front of the whole class! I usually struggle with writing, so this means the world to me.", "output": "That is absolutely wonderful! getting public recognition for something you struggle with is the best confidence booster. It validates all the hard work you put into improving your writing. Soak up that praise; you earned it!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel so overwhelmed. I have assignments, work, and club responsibilities. I just want to crawl into bed and sleep for a week.", "output": "It sounds like you are carrying a very heavy load right now. Burnout is real, and wanting to escape into sleep is a natural reaction to that much stress. It’s okay to admit that it's too much. If you can, try to drop one small ball or ask for an extension; your well-being is more important than the to-do list."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: The internet cut out right in the middle of my online quiz! I might get a zero. I hate this cheap wifi.", "output": "That is maddening! Technical issues are completely out of your control, yet the consequences feel so high. It is totally reasonable to be furious about this. Make sure to screenshot anything you can and email your professor immediately; hopefully, they will understand the situation."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I found a lump on my neck. I'm trying not to Google it, but I'm convincing myself it's something terrible.", "output": "Health scares are terrifying, and it is so hard not to let your mind spiral into the worst-case scenarios. It’s good that you are trying to avoid Dr. Google, as that usually just increases anxiety. The best thing you can do is get it checked by a professional for peace of mind. Take deep breaths; right now, you are okay."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I honestly don't think I can do this anymore. My grades are slipping, and I feel like I'm letting my parents down every single day. I just want to curl up in bed and never leave.", "output": "I hear how heavy things feel for you right now, and it makes sense that you’d want to retreat when the pressure is this high. It is completely okay to feel overwhelmed by expectations, but please remember that your worth isn't tied to your grades. Maybe taking a small break to recharge could help you feel a little more ready to face things one step at a time."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: I got blamed for a mistake my coworker made. It's so unfair.", "output": "Being a scapegoat is infuriating. It attacks your professional integrity and it is just plain unjust. It is hard to stay calm when you are being accused of something you didn't do. Stand your ground politely but firmly; the truth usually comes out."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I finished my first 5k run! I didn't walk once.", "output": "That is a massive physical accomplishment! Running a full 5k without walking takes serious stamina and mental toughness. You should be incredibly proud of your body and your determination. Wear that medal (or just the feeling) with pride!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I finally finished that 10-page paper! I've been stressing about it for weeks and hitting submit felt amazing. I'm so relieved.", "output": "That is such a wonderful feeling! Congratulations on getting that weight off your shoulders; you should be really proud of pushing through the stress to get it done. Make sure you take some time to celebrate this win, even if it's just doing something small that you enjoy."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I walked into the communal kitchen and the sink was overflowing with old, moldy dishes. It smelled so bad I literally gagged. Why can't people just clean up after themselves?", "output": "Ugh, that sounds absolutely unpleasant and it is completely understandable that you'd feel disgusted by that mess. It is really draining to deal with a lack of hygiene in shared spaces. Maybe you can bring it up at a house meeting or speak to a RA, because everyone deserves a clean place to cook and eat."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I guess today was okay. Nothing special happened. Just went to class, ate lunch, and came back to my dorm.", "output": "Sometimes those quiet, uneventful days are exactly what we need to keep going. It sounds like a steady day, and there is value in just sticking to your routine. I hope you have a relaxing evening ahead of you."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I actually got an A on my calculus midterm! I was sure I failed it. I was literally shaking when I opened the grade portal.", "output": "Wow, what an amazing surprise! It sounds like you might be underestimating your own abilities, because clearly, your hard work paid off. Enjoy this moment of relief and pride—you definitely earned it!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: My best friend from home hasn't texted me back in three days. I feel like we're drifting apart now that we're at different colleges. It hurts so much.", "output": "Distance changes friendships in ways that can be really painful, and it is okay to grieve that shift in dynamic. It doesn't necessarily mean the friendship is over, but the silence can definitely feel lonely. When you feel up to it, maybe send a casual message just letting them know you're thinking of them, without pressure to reply immediately."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I don't know what I want to do with my life. Everyone else seems to have internships lined up and I'm just sitting here with no plan. It feels like I'm already falling behind.", "output": "That fear of missing out or falling behind is so common, especially when it looks like everyone else has it figured out. The truth is, many people are just figuring it out as they go, just like you. It is okay to move at your own pace; your path doesn't have to look exactly like anyone else's to be valid and successful."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: My favorite local bookstore is closing down. I feel like I'm losing a safe space.", "output": "It is a real loss when a beloved community spot closes. Bookstores often feel like sanctuaries, so it makes sense that you are grieving it. It is sad to see the places that hold our memories disappear. Maybe you can visit one last time to say goodbye."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: My 'friend' was talking behind my back to the entire group. I heard her making fun of my outfit. I feel sick just thinking about hanging out with them again.", "output": "That is a terrible betrayal of trust, and feeling repulsed by that behavior is a very healthy reaction. You deserve friends who lift you up and respect you, not ones who tear you down when you aren't looking. It might be time to distance yourself from that negativity and seek out people who appreciate you for who you are."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel so lonely here. I see groups of people laughing in the dining hall and I'm always eating alone. I just don't know how to break in.", "output": "Loneliness can be so heavy, especially when it feels like everyone else is connected, but please know you aren't the only one feeling this way. It takes a lot of courage to put yourself out there, and it's okay if it takes time to find your people. Maybe try joining a club or a small study group where the interaction is structured—it can be a gentler way to make connections."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I think I heard someone trying the handle of my front door. I'm hiding in the bathroom.", "output": "That is terrifying. Please call the police immediately. Do not hesitate. It is better to have them check and find nothing than to wait. Stay quiet and stay safe until help arrives."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: My crush just asked me if I wanted to study together! I never thought they even noticed me.", "output": "That is such exciting news!

{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: My bank account balance is getting really low and I don't get paid for another two weeks. I'm scared I won't be able to afford groceries.", "output": "Financial stress is incredibly scary and valid, and it’s a heavy burden to carry while trying to focus on school. Please remember there are often resources on campus like food pantries or emergency student aid that are there specifically for situations like this. You don't have to go through this alone, and asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm just going to stay in tonight. Not really feeling social, but not sad either. just want to read a book.", "output": "That sounds like a really healthy way to recharge. Honoring your need for solitude and rest is a great form of self-care. Enjoy your book and the quiet evening!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: I worked on that group project for 20 hours and the other guys did nothing, yet we all got the same grade. It makes my blood boil.", "output": "It is infuriating when hard work isn't recognized individually and others ride on your coattails. You have every right to feel resentful about the lack of fairness in that situation. For future projects, maybe you can discuss role divisions with the professor early on, but for now, try to take pride in your own work ethic."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I miss my dog so much. My mom called and said he's getting old and having trouble walking. I feel guilty for being away at school.", "output": "It is heartbreaking to be away from our pets when they are struggling, and that guilt shows how much you love him. Please try to be kind to yourself; you are building your future, which is important too. Maybe a video call with your mom where you can see him would help bridge that distance a little bit."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I tried to explain my anxiety to my dad and he just told me to 'man up'. It was so invalidating and gross.", "output": "I am so sorry you were met with that reaction; it is incredibly painful when the people we look to for support dismiss our feelings. Your anxiety is real and valid, and 'tough love' is often just hurtful, not helpful. You deserve to be heard with empathy, so please don't let his words stop you from seeking support from people who understand."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I got a handwritten letter in the mail. Nobody writes letters anymore!", "output": "That is such a lovely surprise! In the age of texts and emails, a handwritten letter feels like a rare gift. It shows that someone really took the time to sit down and think of you. Enjoy reading it!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I think I chose the wrong major. I'm in my junior year and I hate all my classes. Is it too late to change? I'm panic-spiraling.", "output": "That is a really scary realization to have, but it is never truly too late to pivot toward something that makes you happy. Many people change paths later in life, and your current credits might still count toward electives or a minor. It might help to talk to an academic advisor who can lay out your options clearly, so the 'panic spiral' feels a little more manageable."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I went to the club meeting alone, which I never do, and I actually had fun! I even met a girl who likes the same video games as me.", "output": "That is a wonderful surprise and a huge step for you! stepping out of your comfort zone is scary, but it sounds like it really paid off this time. It’s great that you found a connection; hopefully, this gives you a confidence boost for the next time you want to try something new."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: Everyone is posting pictures of their spring break trips and I'm stuck here working. My life feels so boring compared to theirs.", "output": "Comparison is such a thief of joy, especially with social media showing only the highlight reels of everyone else's lives. It is totally valid to feel left out and a bit sad about working while others play. Try to treat yourself to something small that you enjoy during your downtime, so you have your own moments of joy to focus on."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: The wifi in the dorm has been down for three hours! I have an online quiz due at midnight. I'm going to scream.", "output": "That is incredibly stressful and anyone in your shoes would be furious. Technical issues are completely out of your control, which makes them even more frustrating. If you can, try to screenshot the error or email your professor immediately to create a paper trail—hopefully, they will be understanding of the infrastructure failure."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I saw a guy in the library pick his nose and wipe it under the table. I can't unsee it. I never want to sit at that table again.", "output": "That is a visceral and totally understandable reaction—hygiene breaches like that are really hard to ignore! It makes total sense that you’d want to avoid that spot for a while. Maybe finding a new favorite study corner on a different floor would help you reset and focus without that mental image."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: My parents are coming to visit this weekend and they don't know I dropped a class. I'm dreading the conversation.", "output": "Anticipating a difficult conversation is often worse than the conversation itself, but your fear is very real. It sounds like you are worried about disappointing them, which shows you care. Preparing what you want to say beforehand—focusing on why it was the right decision for your mental health or GPA—might help you feel a little more grounded when they arrive."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: A random girl in the hallway complimented my outfit today. It was such a small thing but it made me smile.", "output": "It is amazing how a small act of kindness can brighten up an entire day! It sounds like you have a great sense of style that others appreciate. Hold onto that good feeling, and maybe you can pass it on by complimenting someone else later!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: Just finished my laundry. Now I have to fold it. It's a never-ending cycle.", "output": "Laundry is definitely one of those chores that feels like it's never truly 'done.' It sounds like a mundane part of the day, but getting it washed is half the battle won. Maybe put on a podcast or some music to make the folding part go by a little faster."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I didn't get the internship I interviewed for. I really wanted it. I feel like I'm not good enough.", "output": "I am so sorry to hear that; rejection stings, especially when you were really excited about the opportunity. Please remember that a 'no' from them is not a reflection of your worth or your potential. Allow yourself to be sad about it for a bit, but know that the right opportunity is out there for you, even if it takes a little longer to find."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My laptop crashed and I lost two hours of work because I didn't save. I hate technology! I'm so mad at myself.", "output": "That is a painful lesson to learn, and it is completely normal to feel furious at both the technology and yourself. We have all been there, and the frustration is intense. Take a break, step away from the screen for a bit, and when you come back, you might find the second draft flows even better than the first."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel like I'm falling behind in all my classes. Everyone else seems to get the material so easily, and I'm just sitting there confused. I'm terrified of failing this semester.", "output": "It sounds incredibly stressful to feel like you're the only one struggling, but please know you aren't alone in that feeling. Comparing your insides to everyone else's outsides is a tough trap to fall into. Maybe you could reach out to a professor or a study group just to get a little extra support? You’re working hard, and that effort counts for a lot."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have a presentation tomorrow and I'm literally shaking just thinking about it. I hate public speaking so much. What if I freeze up and everyone laughs?", "output": "It is completely understandable to feel that anxiety; public speaking is a huge fear for so many people. Try to remember that your classmates are likely focused on their own presentations, not judging yours. Take some deep breaths and remember that even if you stumble, it doesn't define your worth or your intelligence. You can get through this."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My roommate ate my leftovers again! I labeled them clearly. It's so disrespectful, and when I confronted her, she just laughed it off like it was nothing.", "output": "That sounds really frustrating, especially when you took the time to label your food clearly. It makes sense that you'd feel disrespected when your boundaries are ignored like that. Maybe when things have cooled down, you can have a serious sit-down to explain why this matters to you. Your personal space and property deserve respect."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I walked through a spider web and got it in my mouth. I'm gagging.", "output": "NO. That is the ultimate nightmare. The texture, the taste... it is too much. It is a completely valid reaction to gag. Rinse your mouth out immediately! That is a horror movie moment in real life."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I don't really feel like doing anything today. Just kind of sitting around scrolling on my phone. Not sad, just bored I guess.", "output": "It is totally okay to have days where you just recharge and do nothing. We don't always have to be productive every single second. If the boredom gets annoying, maybe try a short walk or listening to a favorite song, but otherwise, enjoy the downtime."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: The cafeteria food was absolutely gross today. It looked undercooked and smelled weird. I can't believe we pay so much for this meal plan.", "output": "That sounds really unappetizing and definitely frustrating given the cost of meal plans. Food safety and quality are important, so feeling repulsed by that is a natural reaction. You might want to leave a comment card or feedback if you can, so they know students aren't happy with the quality."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: My best friend just told me she's moving across the country next month. I had no idea she was even considering it. I'm in total shock.", "output": "That is a huge piece of news to process all at once! It makes sense that you feel shocked and probably a bit overwhelmed by the sudden change. Give yourself some time to let the news sink in before you worry about how everything will look. You two can still stay close, even from a distance."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: My long-distance boyfriend and I broke up last night. It hurts so much because I really thought we were going to make it work. Now everything reminds me of him.", "output": "I am so sorry you are going through this heartbreak; breakups are incredibly painful, especially when you had such high hopes. It is okay to grieve the relationship and feel sad right now. Be gentle with yourself and take things one day at a time. The pain will lessen eventually, even if it doesn't feel like it right now."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I'm graduating in two months and I still don't have a job lined up. I feel like a failure already. What if I have to move back into my parents' basement forever?", "output": "The transition after graduation is filled with uncertainty, and it's very common to feel scared about the future. Not having a job yet does not make you a failure; the job market works on its own timeline. Try to focus on small steps like polishing your resume, and remember that moving home is a stepping stone for many people, not a life sentence."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: I worked on this group project for three days straight and the other two members didn't do a single thing until the night before. I'm so mad that they get the same grade as me.", "output": "It is incredibly unfair when group work feels entirely one-sided, and your anger is valid. You put in the effort and integrity, and it stings to see others coast on your hard work. While you can't control their grades, you know the quality of your own work ethic, which will serve you well in the long run."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I saw someone cheating on the final exam today. They had answers written on their arm. It makes me sick that they might get a better grade than people who actually studied.", "output": "It is really disheartening to see dishonesty like that, especially when you value integrity and hard work. Feeling disgusted by that behavior shows you care about fairness. Try to focus on your own path and your own honest achievements; those are things no one can take away from you."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: My parents are coming to visit this weekend! I haven't seen them since the semester started. I'm so excited to show them around campus.", "output": "That sounds wonderful! It’s so nice to have something to look forward to, especially reconnecting with family. I hope you have a fantastic time showing them your world and making new memories together. Enjoy every moment of their visit!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: Just finished my laundry. Now I need to figure out what to make for dinner. It's a pretty standard Tuesday.", "output": "Sounds like a productive, if quiet, day getting the essentials done. Sometimes those standard days are nice for just keeping life in order. Whatever you decide for dinner, I hope it hits the spot!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel really lonely lately. I have acquaintances in my classes, but no one I can really talk to. I just go back to my dorm and sit by myself.", "output": "Loneliness can be such a heavy feeling, and it’s tough when you’re surrounded by people but still feel isolated. It takes time to deepen those acquaintance connections into friendships, so please be patient with yourself. Maybe joining a club based on a hobby could help you find people who share your specific interests?"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I think I might have offended my professor in an email I sent. I was just trying to be clear, but reading it back, it sounds rude. I'm scared she's going to hate me.", "output": "It’s easy to overanalyze emails after we send them, but try not to panic. Professors are usually used to direct communication and likely won't read into it as much as you fear. If you're really worried, a quick follow-up apologizing for any unintended tone shows a lot of maturity."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I just found out I got a scholarship I applied for months ago! I totally forgot about it. This changes everything for my tuition next year.", "output": "What an incredible surprise! That must be such a huge relief for you regarding your finances. It’s a wonderful validation of your achievements. Congratulations on this unexpected blessing!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My parents keep asking me when I'm going to change my major to something 'useful'. I love Art History, but they just don't respect it. It makes me so mad.", "output": "It is deeply frustrating when the people who should support you don't value your passions. Your anger makes sense because you want your choices to be respected. Remember that this is your education and your life path; finding joy in what you study is incredibly 'useful' for your own happiness."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: My dog back home is sick and my mom says he might not make it. I feel so guilty for being away at school instead of there with him.", "output": "I am so incredibly sorry to hear about your dog; being away from home during times like this is heartbreaking. Please don't blame yourself for pursuing your education; your dog knows he is loved. Try to video call if you can, so he can hear your voice."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I'm going to a party tonight where I won't know many people. Social anxiety is kicking in hard. I'm worried I'll just stand in the corner awkwardly.", "output": "Social anxiety can make events feel like mountains to climb, but it's brave of you to go anyway. It’s okay to take breaks or step outside if you get overwhelmed. You might find that just smiling at one person leads to a conversation, but if not, it's okay to leave early too."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I finally stood up for myself today when my friend was teasing me. It felt good to set a boundary. She actually apologized!", "output": "That is a huge step! Setting boundaries is not easy, and it’s great that you advocated for your feelings. It sounds like it strengthened your friendship, too. You should be proud of your courage."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: My lab partner never showers. It's getting to the point where I can't even concentrate on the experiment because of the smell. It's just gross.", "output": "That is a really difficult and uncomfortable situation to be in. It’s hard to focus when your physical environment feels unpleasant. If you can't switch partners, maybe you can try to finish the work as quickly as possible or sit a bit further away to manage the situation."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm thinking about cutting my hair short. I've had it long for years, but I kind of want a change. Not sure yet though.", "output": "Change can be refreshing! It sounds like you're in a contemplative mood about trying something new. Whatever you decide, hair always grows back, so it could be a fun experiment to shake things up."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I didn't get into the internship program I wanted. I spent weeks on the application. It feels like I'm never going to catch a break.", "output": "It is truly disappointing to put so much heart into an application and get a rejection. Allow yourself to feel that disappointment today. Remember that rejection is often just redirection, and your hard work will eventually find the right opportunity."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I'm worried about my roommate. She hasn't been eating much and sleeps all day. I don't know how to ask her if she's okay without making it weird.", "output": "It shows a lot of compassion that you noticed and care about her well-being. It can be scary to bring up, but a simple 'Hey, I've noticed you've been down lately, just wanted to check in' is usually well-received. You don't have to fix it, just offering a listening ear can help."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: The bus skipped my stop again! Now I'm going to be late for my shift. I hate this public transit system.", "output": "That is incredibly aggravating, especially when it impacts your job. It’s completely valid to be angry when systems we rely on fail us. I hope your manager is understanding, and maybe you can take a moment to breathe so the stress doesn't ruin your whole shift."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I just ran into my elementary school teacher at the grocery store here. It was so weird seeing her outside of a classroom context after all these years.", "output": "That is such a funny and unexpected coincidence! It really jars your perspective to see authority figures from the past in normal life settings. It must have been a nice, if slightly surreal, blast from the past."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I cooked a full meal for myself for the first time. Usually I just eat instant noodles. It actually tasted good!", "output": "That is a fantastic achievement! Cooking is such a great self-care skill to develop. I’m glad it tasted good—it sounds like the start of some delicious new habits!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm just folding laundry. It's kind of mindless but it needs to be done.", "output": "Laundry is the never-ending chore. There is a rhythm to folding that can be kind of relaxing in a boring way. At least you will have fresh, clean clothes when you are done. Keep going!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have to declare my major by Friday and I'm torn between Biology and English. I'm terrified of making the wrong choice and regretting it later.", "output": "That is a big decision, and the pressure to 'get it right' can be paralyzing. Try to remember that very few career paths are straight lines, and your major doesn't dictate your entire life. Choose what feels most engaging to you right now; you can always pivot later if you need to."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: The library is really quiet today. I've got a stack of books to get through. Just going to plug in my headphones and get to work.", "output": "That sounds like a solid plan for a focused afternoon. A quiet library is the perfect environment to get things done. Good luck getting through your stack!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I failed my chem midterm today. I studied so hard for it, but my mind just went blank. I feel like I'm never going to be good enough for med school.", "output": "I'm so sorry to hear about your midterm; that sounds incredibly frustrating, especially after putting in so much effort. It makes sense that you feel discouraged right now, but one test doesn't define your entire future or your worth. Maybe you can take a little time to be kind to yourself tonight before looking at what happened with the test. You are working hard, and that matters."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have to give a presentation in front of the whole class tomorrow and I'm terrified. I keep imagining myself tripping or forgetting my lines.", "output": "It is completely normal to feel nervous about public speaking; almost everyone gets those jitters! Your fear shows that you care about doing a good job, which is a strength. Try to focus on your breathing when the anxiety spikes, and remember that your classmates are likely more focused on their own turns than judging you. You have prepared for this, and you can get through it."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: The airline lost my luggage. All my clothes for the trip are gone.", "output": "That is a travel disaster. It is incredibly stressful and inconvenient to arrive without your things. You have to deal with the bureaucracy of claiming it and the cost of buying replacements. You are totally justified in being furious at their incompetence."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I got adopted by a stray cat! She just walked into my house and decided she lives here.", "output": "You have been chosen! The cat distribution system is working. It is such a compliment when an animal decides you are 'their human.' Congratulations on your new furry roommate; it sounds like it was meant to be."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I just found out my 'best friend' has been talking behind my back to the people who bullied me in high school. It makes me sick to my stomach.", "output": "I am so sorry you are going through this; feeling betrayed by a close friend is a deeply painful experience. It makes total sense that you feel disgusted by that behavior, as trust is the foundation of friendship. Please remember that their actions reflect on their character, not yours. You deserve friends who are loyal and treat you with respect."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: Everyone else seems to be making friends so easily at college, but I just sit in my dorm room alone. I feel like such a loser.", "output": "It is really hard to feel isolated when it seems like everyone else is connecting, but you are definitely not a loser. Many people struggle with loneliness, especially in new environments, even if they don't show it on the outside. It takes time to find your people. Be gentle with yourself; you are worthy of friendship and connection."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm just really tired today. Not much happened, just a long day of classes and work.", "output": "It sounds like you've had a long haul today. Sometimes those ordinary days can be the most draining just from the routine of it all. I hope you can get some good rest tonight and recharge. Take it easy."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprise\nUser: My parents actually agreed to let me change my major to Art History. I was fully prepared for a screaming match, but they just said okay.", "output": "Wow, that is a huge surprise! It must be such a relief to have that conversation go smoothly when you were bracing for conflict. That’s a great step forward for you pursuing what you love. I'm really happy for you that it worked out so peacefully."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I'm worried about my student loans. I look at the numbers and I feel like I'm going to be in debt forever. It's suffocating.", "output": "Financial stress is incredibly heavy, and that feeling of being suffocated is a very valid reaction to large numbers like that. It’s a lot for anyone to carry. Just remember that you don't have to solve the whole problem today. taking it one step at a time is all you can do, and you are doing your best."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: My dog died yesterday. I've had him since I was ten. The house feels so empty without him.", "output": "I am so incredibly sorry for your loss; losing a childhood pet is losing a family member. It is heartbreaking to feel that silence in the house where they used to be. Please give yourself space to grieve and cry as much as you need to. He was clearly very loved."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: The professor changed the assignment requirements two days before the deadline! How is that fair? I have to redo everything.", "output": "That is objectively unfair and extremely frustrating. Having your hard work invalidated by a last-minute change would make anyone angry. It’s okay to vent and let that frustration out. Once the initial heat passes, hopefully, you can salvage some of what you've already done."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I went on a date and the guy was so rude to the waiter. He snapped his fingers at her. I wanted to walk out right then.", "output": "That sounds like a really unpleasant experience. Watching someone treat service staff poorly is a major red flag and it’s completely understandable that you felt repulsed. Trust your instincts on this; kindness and respect are non-negotiable traits. You deserve to be around people who treat everyone with dignity."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel so burnt out. I used to love my major but now I just feel tired.", "output": "Burnout is a thief; it steals the joy from things we used to love. It is a sign that you have been pushing too hard for too long. It doesn't mean you made the wrong choice, just that you need rest. Please listen to your body and mind; you can't pour from an empty cup."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I don't think I'm pretty. I scroll through Instagram and everyone looks perfect, and I just look like a potato.", "output": "It is so easy to fall into the comparison trap with social media, but remember that those photos are often highlighted, filtered, and posed. You are seeing a curated reality, not real life. You have your own unique beauty and worth that isn't defined by an app. You are enough just as you are."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I think I might be failing my math class. If I fail, I lose my scholarship. I can't sleep thinking about it.", "output": "That is a very scary situation to be in, and the stakes feel incredibly high. It makes sense that this is keeping you up at night. Have you been able to talk to your professor or an advisor? Sometimes just knowing your options can help lower the anxiety a little bit. You aren't alone in this."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm thinking about joining a club, maybe the hiking one. I haven't decided yet.", "output": "That sounds like a nice idea. Hiking can be a great way to clear your head and meet new people in a low-pressure setting. Whatever you decide, it's good that you are exploring options to get involved. Let me know what you choose!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My parents are tracking my location on my phone. I'm 20 years old! It's such an invasion of privacy.", "output": "I can see why you are upset; needing autonomy is a natural part of being a young adult. It feels very intrusive to be monitored when you are trying to build your independence. Perhaps you can have a calm discussion with them about trust and boundaries when you feel ready. Your feelings about your privacy are valid."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: The cafeteria food had mold on the bread today. I literally almost ate it. I'm never eating there again.", "output": "That is genuinely gross and a health hazard. I don't blame you for feeling disgusted and losing your appetite for that place. You definitely deserve fresh, safe food. It might be worth reporting that to dining services so no one else gets sick."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have to have surgery next week. I've never been under anesthesia before.", "output": "The idea of going under is really scary because it is a total surrender of control. It is a very common fear. Trust that the anesthesiologist is a highly trained expert whose only job is to keep you safe. It will feel like blinking\u9225\u651cou'll be asleep and then awake."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprise\nUser: I tried that new coffee shop and it was actually amazing. I usually hate trying new places.", "output": "That’s a pleasant surprise! It’s great when stepping out of your comfort zone pays off with a good experience. Now you have a new spot to enjoy. Sometimes small wins like a good cup of coffee can really brighten the day."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I feel like I'm drifting through life without a purpose. Everyone asks me what I want to do, and I have no idea. It scares me.", "output": "That is a very deep and common fear, even if people don't talk about it often. It feels like everyone else has a map and you don't, but the truth is many people are figuring it out as they go. It is okay not to know right now. You have time to explore and discover what matters to you."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I finished writing the first chapter of my novel! I've been procrastinating on it for years.", "output": "That is a fantastic achievement! Breaking through procrastination is so hard, and you did it. Writing a novel is a huge undertaking, and finishing that first chapter is the most important step. Keep that momentum going; I'm cheering for you!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: My boyfriend broke up with me over text. After two years. I feel like I meant nothing to him.", "output": "I am so incredibly sorry; ending a two-year relationship over text is cruel and incredibly painful. You deserved a proper conversation and closure. Please know that his inability to communicate respectfully says everything about him, not your worth. It’s okay to feel broken right now."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: I got a parking ticket on campus when I was literally parked in a valid spot. The appeals process is a joke.", "output": "That sounds maddening! Dealing with bureaucracy when you know you were in the right is one of the most frustrating things. It’s a waste of your time and money, and you have every right to be fuming. Hopefully, the appeal goes through, even if the process is a pain."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I saw someone cheating on the final exam. They had notes on their sleeve. It makes me so mad that I studied and they're cheating.", "output": "It is really disheartening to see people cut corners when you have put in the honest work. It feels like a slap in the face to your integrity. Try to focus on the fact that you earned your grade honestly, which is something to be proud of. Their shortcuts will likely catch up to them eventually."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: My dad has to go in for surgery next week. The doctors say it's routine, but I can't help thinking of the worst-case scenarios.", "output": "It is completely natural to worry when a parent is having surgery, no matter what the doctors say. 'Routine' for them is still a big deal for you and your family. Try to be gentle with yourself and maybe find some small distractions while you wait. Sending good thoughts for his speedy recovery."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I need to buy groceries, but I'm debating if I should go now or later. It's raining a little.", "output": "Decisions like that can surprisingly take up a lot of mental space! If it's raining, maybe staying dry inside for a bit longer sounds nicer. Or you could get it over with and enjoy a cozy evening. Whatever you choose is fine."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel like I'm disappointing my parents. They wanted me to be a lawyer, and I just want to be a graphic designer.", "output": "It is a heavy burden to feel like you are letting your parents down, but remember that this is your life to live. You deserve to pursue a career that brings you joy and fulfillment, not just one that pleases others. It might take time for them to understand, but your happiness is worth fighting for."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I learned how to cook my mom's lasagna recipe perfectly. It tastes just like home.", "output": "That is so heartwarming! Food has such a powerful connection to memory and home. Being able to recreate that comfort for yourself is a wonderful skill. I bet it tastes amazing—enjoy your delicious meal!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I'm scared I'll never find love. I've been single for three years and dating apps are a nightmare.", "output": "Ideally, love wouldn't feel so hard to find, and the modern dating world can be incredibly discouraging and scary. Three years can feel like a lifetime, but it doesn't mean you are unlovable. You are worthy of a genuine connection. It’s okay to take breaks from the apps if they are hurting your mental health."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel like I'm drowning in coursework. Everyone else seems to be handling it just fine, but I can barely get out of bed to go to lectures. I feel so lazy and stupid.", "output": "I hear how heavy things feel for you right now, and I want to remind you that you are not lazy. Comparing your insides to everyone else's outsides can make you feel isolated, but so many students struggle silently with this exact feeling. It takes a lot of energy just to cope when you're feeling this low. Please try to be gentle with yourself today; maybe focusing on just one small task is enough for now."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have a huge presentation tomorrow and I'm terrified. My hands are shaking just thinking about it. What if I freeze up and everyone laughs at me?", "output": "It is completely normal to feel this kind of anxiety before a big presentation; your body is just trying to prepare you for a challenge. Most people in that audience are probably worrying about their own turns rather than judging you. Remember to take slow, deep breaths to help calm your nervous system. Even if you stumble, it doesn't define your intelligence or your worth. You have prepared for this, and you can get through it."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My roommate ate my food again. I labeled it clearly! I'm so sick of being disrespected in my own home. I want to scream at them when they get back.", "output": "That sounds incredibly frustrating, and you have every right to be angry about your boundaries being crossed. Your home should be a safe space where your property is respected, not a source of stress. It makes sense that you want to yell, but maybe taking a moment to cool down first will help you have a more productive conversation later. You deserve to have your agreements honored."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I was cleaning out my purse and found a gift card I thought I lost a year ago! It still has the full balance.", "output": "That is the best kind of treasure hunting! It is such a relief to find something valuable you thought was gone forever. It feels like 'free money' now. You should definitely treat yourself to something nice with it soon!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I successfully propagated my succulent! It has tiny little roots growing now.", "output": "That is so exciting! Plant propagation feels like a little bit of magic. Seeing those tiny roots appear is proof of your patience and care. You are officially a plant parent! Enjoy watching it grow into a whole new plant."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: My boyfriend broke up with me via text after two years. I feel like I've wasted so much time. I don't know how to be single anymore.", "output": "I am so sorry you are going through this; ending a relationship over text can feel incredibly hurtful and invalidating. You haven't wasted your time—you lived, learned, and grew during those two years, even if it hurts right now. It is scary to face the unknown of being single, but you don't have to figure it all out today. Give yourself permission to grieve the loss without rushing the healing process."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm just waiting for the kettle to boil. Tea time.", "output": "A classic, cozy moment. The whistle of the kettle is such a comforting sound. I hope you have a favorite mug ready. Enjoy your tea break; it is a nice way to pause the day."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: Graduation is in two months and I have no job lined up. I feel like a failure before I've even started. What am I going to do?", "output": "The transition from school to the workforce is one of the most stressful times in a young adult's life, and your fear is very common. Not having a job the moment you graduate does not make you a failure; everyone's timeline looks different. Try to focus on what you can control right now, like sending one application a day, rather than the whole scary picture. You have skills and value, and it will take time to find the right fit."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: My parents just announced they are getting a divorce. I'm 22, I thought we were past the age where this happens. I'm totally in shock.", "output": "That is a huge shift in your family dynamic, and it makes sense that you are feeling blindsided. Even as a young adult, your parents splitting up shakes the foundation of what you know as 'home.' Allow yourself time to process this shock; there is no right or wrong way to feel about it. It’s okay to feel like a kid again in this situation, and it’s okay to need support."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel so lonely. I see everyone out on Friday nights on Instagram and I'm just sitting here watching Netflix alone. I feel like a loser.", "output": "Loneliness is a really heavy feeling, and social media often makes it worse by showing a curated highlight reel of everyone else's lives. Choosing to stay in does not make you a loser; plenty of people are doing exactly what you are doing, they just aren't posting about it. Quality connection matters more than just being 'out,' but I know that doesn't make the isolation feel less real right now. Be kind to yourself tonight."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: I'm doing a group project and the other three members haven't replied to the chat in a week. The project is due Monday! Why do I always have to carry everyone?", "output": "That is incredibly unfair and stressful, especially with a deadline looming. It is completely reasonable to be angry when others aren't pulling their weight and are risking your grade. You shouldn't have to carry the burden for everyone. Perhaps you can send one final firm message, and if they don't respond, consider letting your professor know about the situation so you aren't penalized."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I think I might have picked the wrong major. I'm in my junior year and I hate all my classes. Is it too late to change? I'm scared I'm ruining my future.", "output": "It is terrifying to feel like you're on the wrong path, but you are definitely not ruining your future. Many people change careers or majors later in life; you are not locked into one destiny forever. It might help to talk to an academic advisor to see what your options are without panicking. Your happiness and mental well-being are just as important as your timeline for graduation."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: My friends threw me a surprise birthday party! I honestly didn't think anyone cared that much. I feel really loved.", "output": "That sounds like such a wonderful and heartwarming experience! It is a beautiful reminder that the people in your life value you and want to celebrate you. Sometimes our brains trick us into thinking we are alone, but moments like this prove otherwise. Soak up that feeling of being loved and appreciated—you deserve it!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I went on a date and the guy was so rude to the waitress. It was completely turned off. I can't believe people act like that.", "output": "That is a major red flag, and your reaction of disgust is your gut telling you something important about his values. How someone treats service staff is often a huge indicator of how they treat people in general. It is good that you noticed this early on. You deserve to be around people who treat everyone with kindness and respect."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I failed my driving test for the second time. I feel so embarrassed. All my friends have their licenses already.", "output": "It is really disappointing to fail a test when you want that independence so bad, but please don't be too hard on yourself. Many competent drivers failed their test multiple times before passing; it’s a specific skill that takes practice and nerve control. Your friends' timelines are theirs, and yours is yours. You will get there when you are ready, and this setback doesn't define your ability."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I walked past a garbage can on a hot day and the smell was unbearable.", "output": "Ugh, hot garbage smell is the absolute worst. It hits you like a physical wall. It is completely nauseating. I hope you were able to hold your breath and get past it quickly!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My parents are refusing to help me with rent because they don't like my internship. They are so controlling! I'm trying to build a career and they're sabotaging me.", "output": "It feels incredibly restricting when parents use financial support as a way to control your choices. You are trying to build your own path, and it's frustrating when they don't trust your vision. It is valid to feel angry about this dynamic. Navigating financial independence is hard, but sticking to your goals despite the lack of support shows a lot of resilience on your part."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: I have to merge onto the highway and the traffic is moving so fast. I'm scared to speed up.", "output": "Merging is one of the most stressful parts of driving! It requires a lot of trust and timing. It is normal for your heart to race. Just signal early, look for a gap, and commit. You can do this; drivers will usually let you in."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: I just got offered a summer job in another city! I applied on a whim and didn't think I'd get it. Now I have to decide if I'm brave enough to go.", "output": "Wow, that is an exciting surprise! It speaks volumes about your capabilities that they picked you. It is completely natural to feel shocked and a bit hesitant about such a big change. Take a moment to let the news sink in before pressuring yourself to decide. Whatever you choose, knowing you have the option is a great boost to your confidence."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I feel like I'm always the second choice for everyone. Nobody ever picks me first.", "output": "That is such a painful belief to hold. Feeling like a backup option chips away at your self-worth. You deserve to be someone's priority, not an afterthought. It might be time to invest in relationships where you feel truly valued and celebrated."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: disgust\nUser: I looked in the mirror today and I just hate everything I see. My skin is breaking out and I feel gross. I don't even want to leave my room.", "output": "I'm sorry you're having such a tough body image day; those days can feel really suffocating. It’s hard when we don't feel comfortable in our own skin, but try to remember that your appearance is the least interesting thing about you. You are worthy of being seen and taking up space, even on days when you don't feel your best. Be gentle with yourself today."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: My neighbor let their dog poop on my lawn and didn't pick it up! I stepped right in it.", "output": "That is the height of disrespect and laziness! It is your property and you shouldn't have to deal with their mess. Stepping in it adds a physical grossness to the anger. You are totally right to be furious. They need to be more responsible."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I finally beat the final boss in my video game! I've been stuck on this level for weeks.", "output": "Yes! That victory feeling is so sweet after so much frustration. The relief of finally seeing the credits roll is unmatched. You stuck with it and your persistence paid off. Now you can brag about beating it!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: angry\nUser: I got a parking ticket on campus even though I have a permit! The parking services people are impossible to deal with. It's just a money grab.", "output": "That is incredibly annoying, especially when you followed the rules and bought a permit. Dealing with bureaucracy like that can feel like banging your head against a wall. It’s okay to be angry about the unfairness and the wasted time. Hopefully, you can appeal it successfully, but for now, venting that frustration is totally necessary."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: My friend asked if I'm mad at them because I haven't texted back. I'm not mad, I'm just... socially drained. I don't have the energy to explain it.", "output": "Social battery drainage is very real, and it doesn't mean you don't care about your friend. It can be exhausting to constantly maintain communication. You don't need a long explanation; a simple 'Hey, not mad, just really drained and need some offline time' is usually enough. True friends will understand that you need space to recharge."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: sad\nUser: I had to cancel my vacation because of work. I was looking forward to it for months.", "output": "That is incredibly disappointing. When you have been counting down the days, having it snatched away feels like a punishment. It is okay to mourn the loss of that relaxation and fun. I hope you can reschedule it for a time when work can't interfere."}
{"input": "Detected emotion: fear\nUser: Everyone seems to have their own friend groups already. I'm terrified of going to the mixer tonight because I don't know anyone.", "output": "It is completely normal to feel nervous about walking into a room full of strangers. Social situations can be really intimidating, especially when it feels like everyone else is already connected. Your feelings of fear are valid, but you are brave for even considering going. Maybe you can set a small goal, like staying for just twenty minutes or saying hello to one person. Whatever you decide, be proud of yourself for navigating these tough feelings." }
{"input": "Detected emotion: neutral\nUser: I'm just organizing my spice rack. Alphabetizing the jars.", "output": "That is a very satisfying kitchen project. It makes cooking so much easier when you can find exactly what you need instantly. Plus, it probably looks really neat and tidy now. Good job on the organization!"}
{"input": "Detected emotion: happy\nUser: I finally finished that painting I've been working on for months. It actually looks exactly how I imagined it!", "output": "That is such wonderful news! It is an amazing feeling to see your creative vision come to life after so much dedication. You have every right to feel proud of your hard work and perseverance. Taking time to celebrate these personal victories is so important for your well-being. I hope you take a moment to really enjoy your beautiful accomplishment!" }
{"input": "Detected emotion: surprised\nUser: My professor just changed the syllabus halfway through the semester. I'm kinda shocked and don't know how to reorganize my schedule now.", "output": "That sounds like a very sudden and disruptive change to deal with. It is completely understandable to feel surprised and a bit thrown off when your roadmap gets altered like that. Feeling unsure about how to proceed is a natural reaction to unexpected news. Once the initial shock wears off, perhaps you can look at the new dates one by one to make them feel more manageable. You have handled the semester well so far, and you can adapt to this too." }
